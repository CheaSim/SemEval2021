{"article": "In his first broadcast interview, Kweku Adoboli told the BBC that banking was still riven by conflicts of interest. He added that traders were pushed to make profits \"no matter what\". Asked if the crimes he committed - booking fictitious trades to cover up gambles in the hunt for profits - could happen again, he said: \"Absolutely\". Adoboli - the biggest rogue trader in British history and described by the prosecution at his trial as a \"master fraudster\" and \"sophisticated liar\" - now faces deportation to Ghana, where he was born. He said he is fighting the order as he is as \"British in culture\" as anyone living in the UK and could help the finance sector to reform by sharing his experiences. After coming out of prison a year ago, 36-year-old Adoboli, who has lived in Britain since he was 12, said he had been prevented from taking paid work. He is living with friends in Edinburgh and speaks for free at banking compliance conferences. I asked him if behaviour in banking had changed since he was found guilty in 2012 of two counts of fraud and sentenced to seven years in prison. \"No, certainly not,\" he answered. \"I think the young people I've spoken to, former colleagues I have spoken to, are still struggling with the same issues, the same conflicts, the same pressures to achieve no matter what. \"And this goes back to the structure of the industry. People are required to take risk to generate profit, because yields in the industry are consistently compressed. \"And if investment banks continue to chase the same level of profitability as they have in the past, the only way to generate those profits is to take more risk. \"But from a politics angle, the desire is to limit that risk taking, to limit the profitability, but you have these conflicted goals. \"And where the conflict comes is where people fall into this grey zone, and so I think it can absolutely happen again. \"Especially as we go into what could be the next phase of the great financial crisis over the next 12 to 24 months.\" Adoboli said that he was sorry for his actions, which at one stage had the potential to undermine the whole operation of UBS after his possible losses rose to over £8bn ($10.6bn). His actions included setting up secret internal slush funds and booking fictitious deals to hide the amount of risk he was taking. Multi-million pound bets on movements in the stock markets also failed to come off. He claimed others at the bank knew of his actions and he was put under enormous pressure to make high levels of profit. UBS has denied that anyone else knew what Adoboli was doing and no charges have been brought against any other UBS traders. A number testified in court that Adoboli had been operating alone. I asked him if he should apologise. \"Absolutely,\" he said. \"I am devastated not for myself but for my institution and the people I have worked with. \"The very first thing I did when I was arrested was say I'm sorry beyond words and I said it through my lawyers, but that is what I said. \"During my trial I said it repeatedly. \"And these are not just devices. It's how I feel, I failed. I made mistakes. \"People around me made mistakes too, but that's not the point. \"I unreservedly apologise for what happened - it was a huge failure and part of the redemption is about that. \"Part of rehabilitation is about facing up to your choices, what was wrong with them, and how do you move forward. \"The only way to move forward is to face it with full honesty. \"I went to prison for it. I was asked to pay a price, to accept my dishonesty. \"To accept that I was charged and found guilty of a criminal offence.\" Adoboli is one of the few bankers to be jailed in the UK since the financial crisis. I asked him if more people in the finance sector should face prison after fraudulent behaviour was found in a number of different markets including foreign exchange and the setting of inter-bank interest rates, known as Libor. \"I think people need to be held to account for their failings but I'm not entirely sure - and this is a rather controversial view - I'm not entirely sure blame and sending people to prison is the answer,\" he said. \"It might help society to know people are being held to account but it doesn't solve the problems. \"This is why I say blame is not the answer. \"People do need to be held to account. I went to prison. I learned from it.\" I asked Adoboli if he thought of himself as a criminal. \"I don't think of myself as a criminal,\" he answered. \"It's a label I have. \"A lot of work has been done through my time in prison and with my friends and family to make sure I'm not left with this sense of - you are [only] a criminal. \"[Yes] you made a terrible mistake. \"You made a sequence of terrible choices, but your intentions were always in the right place. \"I accept I was found guilty of a crime that had dishonesty central to it.\"", "question": "The London trader who @placeholder the Swiss bank UBS £ 1.4 bn ( $ 1.9 bn ) has apologised and said that banking has not done enough to regain the public 's trust .", "option_0": "governed", "option_1": "defended", "option_2": "raised", "option_3": "lost", "option_4": "provided", "label": 3}

Prime Minister Theresa May announced in May that the tolls would be scrapped if the Conservatives won the general election in June, with the target date of the end of 2018 confirmed in July. The first Severn Bridge, which opened in 1966 under public ownership, was transferred to Severn River Crossings plc as part of the agreement under which the company built and financed the second crossing, which opened in 1996. Both bridges would be returned to public ownership once construction and maintenance costs had been recovered from the collection of tolls. Mr Davies had written to the Department for Transport on behalf of a constituent, seeking confirmation of the date of transfer. Mr Norman replied saying: \"I am pleased to confirm that the bridges will revert to public ownership on 8 January 2018 and that all tolls will end at the Severn Crossings by the 31 December 2018.\" The Monmouth MP said: \"I'm very pleased with it - it's the confirmation everyone had been expecting and not some wild manifesto promise. \"It's going to be carried out in the timescale promised.\" Mr Davies said he understood there were some unexpected additional maintenance costs to be covered which meant that the tolls would not be lifted immediately.

{"article": "On Thursday, Root himself said he was looking forward to the time when his leadership mettle would be examined. On the first day of the second Test, where South Africa moved on to 309-6, Root got his wish and, in turn, allowed the pressure to ease off the Proteas on more than one occasion. It was a fluctuating day - South Africa were attritional in the first session, fluent after lunch and had to recover following a four-wicket collapse in the evening. They were helped by England opting to use Liam Dawson ahead of fellow spinner Moeen Ali and again in the sleepy overs in the run-up to the second new ball. I'm not the only one confused by England's approach to Moeen, with both Root and coach Trevor Bayliss saying that he is now seen as the second spinner. When confidence is high - as Moeen's should be after taking 10 wickets at Lord's - it is reasonable to expect players to perform for you. Therefore, I was surprised when left-armer Dawson, despite what the England higher-ups are saying about his place in the pecking order, was used before Moeen at Trent Bridge. Media playback is not supported on this device Put simply, we know that Moeen is good enough at this level, but the same cannot yet be said about Dawson, who is playing in only his third Test. Indeed, Dawson was the most expensive of England's bowlers, often providing a release for the South Africa batsmen. It was almost as if Root felt like he had to bowl him simply because he was in the side. In all, the six bowlers that England have in their side is probably too many. It creates a problem for the captain in juggling them, and perhaps even puts doubt in a bowler's mind in that he may be thinking that he has to perform well quickly otherwise he will be replaced by one of the many other options. I would prefer to see England play an extra batsman, even if that does push the talented Moeen down to number eight. The make-up of this side is not one I expect to be mirrored during this winter's Ashes series. When England knew that the new ball was approaching, they allowed the game to drift, fiddling overs from Dawson and Keaton Jennings. It was almost as if they were waiting for James Anderson and Stuart Broad to take the wickets, rather than using the other two of their four seamers - Ben Stokes and Mark Wood - with the old ball. Often, the whole point of a new ball is that you are using it against a new batsman. England may have missed a trick by taking the foot off the gas at that moment. Root's other issue on Friday was the use of the review system, with both of England's referrals frittered away inside 24 overs. On both occasions, headstrong bowlers in Stokes and Broad wanted reviews, only to see that their lbw appeals were turned down for pretty obvious reasons. It's tricky for Root, because the new captain has to feel his way in, not only with the technology, but with experienced bowlers, of whom he wants to gain their trust. In these situations, bowlers are always likely to be biased, with a more streetwise skipper less likely to be concerned by their demands for a review. It is something that Root will learn from and he may well be saying to his players that more discussion is needed to ensure they get the reviews right. All in all, it was an excellent day of Test cricket that leaves the match set-up for the weekend and beyond. South Africa's Quentin de Kock, a freescoring left-hander, made batting look terribly easy before playing a horrible shot, while his opposite number Jonny Bairstow goes from strength to strength behind the stumps for England. After taking a wonderful catch at Lord's, Bairstow took a similar one here to remove Proteas captain Faf du Plessis. From being a keeper who made one mistake per Test, Bairstow has made a massive improvement. There has been talk of bringing in Jos Buttler to allow Bairstow to concentrate on his batting. I can tell you that Bairstow would be devastated if the gloves were taken from him. There was a lovely moment for Anderson, who became the bowler to take 300 Test wickets in England, but I thought he bowled a little too short, especially with the second new ball. Broad, on his home ground, was the pick of England's pace bowlers. It was Broad who took two wickets after tea to begin the South Africa collapse, only for Vernon Philander and Chris Morris to steady their situation. Their efforts have left the contest wonderfully even.

Remember that much of transport policy in London is devolved to the mayor, however there are some differences in how the main parties are approaching it. While there is not a huge amount of detail - for example none of the parties outline what they will do with rail fare increases - here are some highlights: We have come full circle with the Tories and Labour on this issue. Both have supported and opposed the enlargement of Heathrow at different times but now both support expansion. This is despite high profile members in both parties, like Boris Johnson and John McDonnell, opposing it. The parties now agree a third runway is needed for the economy and UK PLC. But it's not the end of the debate for this most contentious of issues. The Conservatives have said it before, and it is in the Labour manifesto, that they will only allow expansion if strict limits on night flights, pollution and noise are abided by. Campaigners have also moved in that direction and also want strong, legally binding limits on a third runway that could even stop it being built. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens oppose expansion so there are plenty of political battles ahead. This is where there are big differences between the two main parties. The Conservatives want to continue with its franchise system, with different rail companies bidding to run services. But Labour wants to renationalise the rail industry, so when franchises come up for renewal they will be put \"back into public ownership\". But it doesn't seem to be a move back to British Rail, the nationalised rail service which ended in 1997. As quoted in the Evening Standard, Labour would hand control of the capital's key commuter routes to Transport for London. The transport authority already runs a model where it pays a private operator to run a service on its behalf, for example the DLR and the London Overground. This means TfL sets the prices and keeps the farebox but also shoulders the revenue risk. Labour also seem to be saying private operators will still be involved in London's commuter routes although there is some debate over whether this is actually renationalisation. The Liberal Democrats say: \"We will allow public sector bodies and mutual groups involving staff and passengers to bid for franchises.\" All the main parties now support HS2 but the Greens do still oppose it. And while the Liberal Democrats and Labour emphasise the need for Crossrail 2 - a rail line to link Hertfordshire to Surrey through central London - the Tories do not mention it in their manifesto. Many experts believe Crossrail 2 is crucial to London to relieve congestion as the city continues to grow. So is it dead?

{"article": "Scientists held their breath as they waited to see whether Juno would make it into orbit - or whether it would just fly off and miss Jupiter completely. Luckily, it successfully began its orbit on Tuesday. It's part of a special mission to help scientists find out more about our biggest planet, and how the solar system began. Juno blasted off in 2011, and will now orbit Jupiter 32 times - floating just 3,100 miles above the planet's cloud tops, for around one year. During this time it will be gathering lots of research and feeding it back to scientists here on Earth. There will also be three passengers on the spacecraft - these three Lego figures. They are the Roman god Jupiter, his wife Juno and the 17th century Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. They had to be made from aluminium rather than plastic so they could cope with the extreme conditions of going into space. Juno's main goal is to try to understand how Jupiter was formed and how it has changed over the years. Scientists hope that by researching this, they will have a better idea of how other giant gas planets are created in different solar systems as well as our own. This is because Jupiter is one of our largest planets, and it's likely it was one of the first planets in our solar system to form when a huge cloud of dust and gas collapsed more than four million years ago. It's mostly made from two gases, hydrogen and helium, which are also present in the Sun. So, scientists think that by studying Jupiter's atmosphere they will learn more about how our planets formed. Jupiter has a very thick layer of gas and cloud surrounding it. Scientists hope that by observing these clouds, and discovering what they are made of, monitoring their temperature, and movements, they can learn more about the planet and other gas planets. One of the things they are hoping to find out, is how much water and ammonia is in Jupiter's atmosphere. Researchers are hoping to find out whether or not Jupiter has a solid core in the middle of the planet. As it is covered in a thick layer of gas, it has been very hard for scientists to learn more about its structure in the past. However, Juno is equipped with some pretty special gadgets which they are hoping will reveal the secrets of Jupiter's centre.

Protests against police killings of unarmed black men continued on Sunday, but turned violent in California. Others demonstrations, including in Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and New York City, were peaceful. Protesters have been angered by the deaths, including those of Eric Garner, killed in a chokehold in New York, and Michael Brown, who was shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson. In both cases grand juries decided not to press criminal charges against the white police officers responsible. \"The horrible events surrounding the death of Eric Garner have revealed a deep crisis of confidence in some of the fundamental elements of our criminal justice system,\" Mr Schneiderman said in a statement. The New York attorney general has asked Governor Cuomo to sign an executive order putting his office in charge of investigating such deaths. \"A common thread in many of these cases is the belief of the victim's family and others that the investigation of the death, and the decision whether to prosecute, have been improperly and unfairly influenced by the close working relationship between the county district attorney and the police officers he or she works with and depends on every day,\" the statement continued. Mr Schneiderman said he had no doubt that the \"overwhelming majority\" of local prosecutors are \"conscientious about our ethical duty to see that justice is done in every case\" but said it was a matter of public confidence.

{"article": "Aberdeen, Glasgow, St Andrews and University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) have been accused of having \"significant\" gender pay gaps. The University and College Union (UCU) said the difference in pay amounted to thousands of pounds. But the universities said UCU had used out of date data that did not reflect \"hard work\" to redress pay issues. The union criticises the universities in its Holding Down Women's Pay report, released to mark International Women's Day. UCU compiled the gender pay figures using its new online tool, Rate for the job, which allows union members to make comparisons between pay rates at universities. UHI was found to have the biggest gender pay gap in the UK, according to UCU's tool. The union said UHI paid female lecturers £18,637 less a year than their male colleagues. The pay gap at Aberdeen was £9,914, Glasgow's £9,244 and St Andrews' £8,699. UCU Scotland official, Mary Senior, said: \"These universities should not have allowed such shameful levels of pay inequality to persist. \"It's nearly 50 years since the Equal Pay Act came into force and they're still flying in the face of it. \"Today on International Women's Day, we'd like to see a firm commitment from sector leaders to close the gap and are offering to work with institutions to put an end to pay inequality.\" UHI is a partnership of 13 colleges and research institutions spread across the Highlands, Western Isles, Northern Isles, Moray and Argyll. A spokesman for the university said UHI recognised that it did have a gender pay gap, but it was not of the \"magnitude\" suggested by UCU. He said: \"The figure and gap quoted derive from the data the university submitted to Higher Education Statistics Agency in 2013/14 in respect of the small number of staff  - 44 - who had academic roles and were employed directly by the university. \"A number of these roles represent the academic staff within the Centre for History and the Centre for Health Sciences, but a significant number are senior roles with pan-university responsibilities.\" Aberdeen University said the UCU figures were not up to date. A spokesman said: \"We have worked extremely hard to redress gender pay issues. Our current gender pay gap for lecturers is 1% and for senior lecturers is 2.5%. \"The professorial pay gap has reduced in recent years to a level of 7% and we continue to address this matter through our senior staff pay policy.\" Glasgow said it was fully committed to gender pay equality.

{"article": "A report commissioned by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the authority was \"not fit for purpose\". Council leader Paul Lakin has resigned and the council cabinet will also quit. An earlier inquiry found 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men, mainly of Pakistani origin, from 1997 to 2013. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the latest report, by Louise Casey, the director-general for troubled families at the Communities Department, identified \"a number of potentially criminal matters\". Files passed to the NCA relate to one former and one existing councillor arising from the inquiry, Ms Casey's spokesperson said. Investigators found the council had a \"deep-rooted\" culture of cover-ups and silencing whistleblowers, Ms Casey said. It also found the child sexual exploitation (CSE) team was poorly directed, suffered from excessive case loads, and did not share information between agencies. Ms Casey said: \"This inspection revealed past and present failures to accept, understand and combat the issue of child sexual exploitation, resulting in a lack of support for victims and insufficient action against known perpetrators.\" A spokesman for the NCA said it would \"examine a number of potentially criminal matters identified during a recent inspection of Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council.\" Mr Pickles said he planned to give control of the council to a team of five commissioners, including an overall lead and one tasked specifically with looking at children's services. 1,400 children were abused, 1997-2013 5 resignations, including South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright and Council leaders Roger Stone and Paul Lakin 5 reports published since August 2014 10 South Yorkshire Police officers under investigation by the IPCC 7,000 documents reviewed for Louise Casey Report They would \"provide new leadership\" and take over the roles of the \"wholly dysfunctional cabinet,\" he said. The council has 14 days to respond to his \"wholly exceptional\" proposals, Mr Pickles said. He also plans to impose early elections in 2016. The elections would give people a chance to \"renew the membership of their council and elect those they have confidence in\", he explained. He said he hoped control would be returned to Rotherham Council as \"rapidly as possible\". In a statement the council said it needed \"time to understand and respond to the detailed report\". It said: \"We recognise the need for a fresh start that is so clearly identified in the report, but also appreciate that we need to continue to deliver services to the people of Rotherham, and ensure business continuity. \"We should not forget that the publication of this report will re-open old wounds for the victims and survivors of CSE. \"We will continue to put in place the help and support they need at this difficult time, including our dedicated helpline.\" Ms Casey was asked by Mr Pickles to inspect the council in the wake of the Jay Report in August 2014. A victim's story \"You could tell with my appearance. I went to five-and-a-half stone and different coloured hair. I was a totally different person. \"Obviously, there were warning signs there. I wasn't going to school, I wasn't going home so there's no way that they couldn't have realised that something was wrong. \"A worker got involved with me. She was trying to tell people what was happening but nobody would listen. \"There were various authorities that knew what was going off and decided to ignore it. I had a child protection officer, she ignored it, someone from social services, they ignored it. \"There were various meetings about me, which were saying if there was anybody found to be dead it'd be me.\" The inspection team reviewed about 7,000 documents, looked in detail at case files and met more than 200 people, including current and former staff, council members, partners, victims and parents. According to the report, child abusers in Rotherham are identified but \"little or no action is taken to stop or even disrupt their activities\". Rotherham Council demonstrated a \"resolute denial\" of the child abuse that was taking place, the report found. Ms Casey said the local authority was \"repeatedly told\" by its own youth service what was happening. It chose, she said \"not only to not act, but to close that service down.\" Attitudes within the council include dismissal of Prof Jay's findings, denial of knowledge of the \"scale and scope\" of CSE, blaming others and denial that CSE remains a serious problem in present-day Rotherham. The council also had an \"excessive deference\" to South Yorkshire Police, preventing the use of council powers to tackle perpetrators, and a lack of scrutiny over the police's actions. Investigators were told that former council leader Roger Stone had been \"a bully\". \"What Stone said, went,\" a senior officer told the investigation. \"Everyone was terrified of Stone.\" A councillor said: \"He is a bully, in my opinion. In Labour group he would impress himself on people, male or female. A lot of women have felt a sense of suppression and macho culture.\" Mr Stone declined to be interviewed by investigators but sent a statement instead. Michael Buchanan, BBC Social Affairs Correspondent In the days after the Alexis Jay report was published, Rotherham council promised much - they'd learn lessons, they'd support victims, they'd change. It hasn't happened. Behind closed doors, they've poured scorn on the Jay report, still fear being called racist rather than acknowledge problems with Pakistani heritage men and most damningly of all are still failing to protect vulnerable children. Faced with such appalling incompetence, the government have acted in the only way they could. Changing the culture and practices of the council won't happen overnight but it's necessary. The people of Rotherham - in particular the children at continuing risk of sexual abuse - deserve nothing else. Ms Casey's report is the latest in a series of investigations following the publication of the Jay Report in August 2014. Prof Alexis Jay found an estimated 1,400 children had been sexually abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. Children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted, trafficked to other cities in England, beaten and intimidated. Staff at the council did not report issues for fear of appearing racist, Ms Casey's report found. But the investigators said that by failing to take action against the abusers of Pakistani heritage, the council had \"inadvertently fuelled the far right and allowed racial tensions to grow\". The report added the lack of action had done a great disservice to the Pakistani community. Two investigations by Commons committees have been launched since the Jay Report was published and a number of high-profile figures have resigned including Shaun Wright, South Yorkshire's police and crime commissioner, who had been a councillor in the town and responsible for children's services. Roger Stone, the chief executive Martin Kimber and the council's director of children's services Joyce Thacker also quit. Mr Wright also refused to be interviewed for Ms Casey's report and sent a statement saying he had been unaware of the extent of the abuse. The National Crime Agency has taken over the investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham and is in the preliminary stage of its inquiry. Last month, Ofsted admitted to the Communities and Local Government Committee that its inspections of children's services in the town had been \"not good enough\". Inspectors from the regulator failed to spot the extent of child sexual exploitation in the town over several years, rating the council as adequate.

Barr, from Cumnock in Ayrshire, appeared at the High Court in Glasgow, having earlier pleaded guilty to assaulting Ms Begg, 51, However, before his guilty plea, Ms Begg had to give evidence against him at a trial in Livingston. She had told the court: \"It was fine at first, but I was not able to give him the full attention he was getting before, so he did not like that. \"I noticed things were not the same. There was a lot more arguments leading up to the violence that happened throughout that period.\" She recalled being \"pummelled\" by Barr while pregnant after rowing with him for going on a day out with a  friend rather than her. She said: \"I was dragged from the living room out to the hallway of the flat by the hair.

{"article": "The Mid-Infrared Instrument (Miri) will gather key data as the $9bn (Â£5.5bn) observatory seeks to identify the first starlight in the Universe. The results of testing conducted at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK have just been signed off, clearing Miri to travel to America. James Webb - regarded as the successor to Hubble - is due to launch in 2018. It will carry a 6.5m primary mirror (more than double the width of Hubble's main mirror), and a shield the size of a tennis court to guard its sensitive vision from the heat and strong light of our Sun. The observatory has been tasked with tracking down the very first luminous objects in the cosmos - groupings of the first generation of stars to burst into life. To do so, Webb will use its infrared detectors to look deeper into space than Hubble, and further back in time - to a period more than 13 billion years ago. \"The other instruments on James Webb will do massive surveys of the sky, looking for these very rare objects; they will find the candidates,\" explained Miri's UK principal investigator, Prof Gillian Wright. \"But Miri has a very special role because it will be the instrument that looks at these candidates to determine which of them is a true first light object.  Only Miri can give us that confirmation,\" she told BBC News. JWST is a co-operative project between the US (Nasa), European (Esa) and Canadian (CSA) space agencies. Europe is providing two of the telescope's four instruments and the Ariane rocket to put it in orbit. Miri is arguably the most versatile of the four instruments, with a much wider range of detectable wavelengths than its peers (5-28 microns). Fundamentally, it is a camera system that will produce pictures of the cosmos. But it also carries a coronagraph to block the light from bright objects so it can see more easily nearby, dimmer targets - such as planets circling their stars. In addition, there is a spectrograph that will slice light into its component colours so scientists can discern something of the chemistry of far-flung phenomena. Miri is a complex design, and will operate at minus 266C. This frigid state is required for the instrument's detectors to sample the faintest of infrared sources.  Everything must be done to ensure the telescope's own heat energy does not swamp the very signal it is pursuing. The hardware for Miri has been developed by institutes and companies from across Europe and America. The job of pulling every item together and assembling the finished system has had its scientific and engineering lead in the UK. Miri has just gone through a rigorous mechanical and thermal test campaign at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire. This included shaking the instrument to simulate the pounding it will receive during the ascent to orbit on the Ariane. It was also put in a vacuum chamber and subjected to the kind of temperatures it will experience in space. \"It's been a real privilege to work on Miri and great to see it finally ship out,\" said Paul Eccleston, the engineer at RAL who has overseen the test campaign. \"It will be so exciting when we put it on top of the rocket and light the blue touch paper, so to speak, and watch it go up into space.\" The paperwork signing off the test results has now been accepted by Nasa. The next step is for Miri to be put in a special environment-controlled shipping box, so it can travel to the US space agency's Goddard centre. The Maryland facility is where the final integration of James Webb will take place. Miri will be fixed inside a cage-like structure called the Integrated Science Instrument Module and positioned just behind the big mirror. The years to 2018 promise yet more testing. Recommended 16 years ago as the logical evolution beyond Hubble, the JWST has managed to garner a fair amount of controversy. Technical difficulties and project mismanagement mean the observatory is now running years behind schedule and is billions of dollars over-budget. Elements of the US Congress wanted to cancel the telescope last summer.  That did not happen, but Capitol Hill now has James Webb on a very short leash, with Nasa required to provide monthly updates on milestones met or missed. Much of the talk around James Webb tends to centre on cost.  The current estimate for the US side is $8.8bn, which covers the full life cycle of the project from its inception to the end of initial operations.  Extra to that bill is some $650m for the European contributions like Miri and Ariane. Dr Eric Smith is Nasa's deputy programme director for James Webb.  He believes taxpayers do appreciate the venture. \"When you're able to show people that James Webb will do things that not even Hubble can do - then they understand it,\" he told BBC News. \"People recognise how iconic Hubble has been, and how much it has affected their lives. \"The images and scientific results that Hubble has returned have permeated popular culture. Webb pictures will be just as sharp but because the telescope will be looking at a different part of the spectrum, it will show us things that are totally new.\"", "question": "One of Europe 's main contributions to the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) is @placeholder and ready to ship to the US .", "option_0": "writing", "option_1": "expanding", "option_2": "set", "option_3": "built", "option_4": "unveiled", "label": 3}

{"article": "His relentless barrage of abuse, not least about \"fake news\", has fatally undermined the trust of the American people in their traditional sources of news; and by denying the Washington press corps access to his administration, he has neutralised a key weapon in the armoury of political journalism. Meanwhile, his use of social media, talk radio and favoured alt-right websites has allowed him to communicate directly to voters, rendering journalists an irrelevant distraction. And the Spicer Doctrine - the belief held by the White House press secretary that it is the job of government to hold media to account and not just the other way round - poses a mortal threat to the trade we call reporting. Any combination of the above paragraphs could appear, without much contention, in almost every appraisal of Trump's relationship with the media that I have read in the past year. That it has limited basis in reality, and indeed is contradicted by the vast bulk of available evidence, has been no impediment to its ubiquity. In fact, contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy, Donald Trump is not the man who will kill the mainstream media. He is the man who could save it. Together with Dominic Hurst, a brilliant producer, I have been looking at Mr Trump's relationship with the media for Radio 4's PM programme. The evidence is emphatic: Trump has given many news organisations the sustainable commercial future they so desperately crave. The New York Times, one of Mr Trump's favourite voodoo dolls, which he has repeatedly admonished on Twitter and in rallies, is doing very well out of the new president. In the three weeks after his election, it sold 132,000 digital subscriptions - a tenfold increase. That's a lot of revenue with which to fund serious journalism. I spoke to Mark Thompson, the paper's chief executive and a former director general of the BBC. He told me that the president's actions and words \"are causing hundreds of thousands of Americans who've never paid for news before to pay for it for the first time\". And he added: \"It's not a political point, it's purely a commercial point: the Trump era seems to be a very good era for quality journalism.\" CNN, the other organisation that Mr Trump has repeatedly labelled as fake news, also has plenty to thank the president for. Thanks to him, 2016 was CNN's most watched year. As for news websites like BuzzFeed News, the Guardian, Mail Online, the Independent and others, Trump has generated phenomenal traffic - which in turn boosts revenues. Two points about Mr Trump's benefit to the mainstream media strike me. The first is that it applies to different platforms and different business models. The New York Times is a newspaper and website with a semi-permeable paywall - the so-called free premium, or freemium model. The Independent has a low cost base and is funded by a huge range of advertising revenue streams. CNN is a cable news network. All are thriving just now. Second, Mr Trump has doubtless fortified the differences between the commercial and editorial departments of outlets such as these three. Take the New York Times. Columnists and leader writers on that gloriously high-minded body, the editorial board, are writing about how awful Mr Trump is, a threat to the republic, an American Putin, these are the end days, and so forth. Meanwhile, Mark Thompson is rubbing his hands with glee - not necessarily at the policies of the president, but at the ambient glow of his bottom line. Throughout my journalistic career, there have been serious questions about how journalism is funded. There is no one or easy answer to that. But based on the evidence above, a very good answer has two words - \"Donald\", and \"Trump\". This brash reality TV star has caused no end of discomfort for the mainstream media. But perhaps what should really make them squirm in their lofty op-ed conferences is the fact that he is doing more than any other modern politician to help them pay their mortgages and feed their families.

Ever since then I've been playing.\" \"A three-year-old in a wheelchair hitting tennis balls - they'd never seen it before. Ever since then I've been playing.\" Raised near Birmingham, she was named after the American basketball icon Michael Jordan. But unlike the NBA megastar, the 22-year-old has never been able to run or jump. Born with brittle bone disease, she has broken her legs more times than she can care to remember. Her mum thinks it's about 26. The first time it happened Whiley was just three months-old and her father Keith was gently winding her at the time. Since then she has been in intensive care, had a series of rods and bolts put into her legs and heard doctors tell her she would never walk unaided. They were wrong - she can now. Along with dogged determination, what Whiley also has in common with her namesake is real talent. Fuelled by winning the British national women's title at the age of 14, she went on to claim a Paralympic bronze medal at London 2012. Of even greater significance was earlier this year when Whiley made history by becoming the first British woman to win a Grand Slam wheelchair tennis title. That ground-breaking Australian Open women's doubles triumph, however, went largely unnoticed. Unlike, say, Paralympic swimming or wheelchair racing, wheelchair tennis has a low profile. Whiley finds this a little surprising, given Britain's love for tennis. But she hopes to help change that. Success is the key to becoming the next David Weir or Ellie Simmonds and, with victory alongside Japanese partner Yui Kamiij at the French Open in Paris in June, a headline-grabbing Grand Slam clean sweep is becoming a distinct possibility. Whiley has lost in the last two Wimbledon finals so is doubly determined to go one better at her favourite tournament. Should success be sealed on home soil, she and Kamiji will be the duo everyone is gunning for at the US Open. \"Winning all the Grand Slams would be amazing,\" says Whiley, whose partnership with Kamiji is ranked second, behind the previously all-conquering Dutch, in the doubles. \"That's the aim for this year.\" Beyond that goal she would like to improve her singles ranking, which is currently fifth, but Whiley is not convinced she could ever top the feeling of winning a Paralympic medal in London. \"The only thing that might be better is winning gold in Rio,\" she says. Already a countdown clock to the 2016 Paralympics is embedded in her tablet computer. Though the Paralympics are a huge motivation for Whiley - especially as it offers the largest scale of exposure - the biggest driving force of all is her father Keith. In an age when the Paralympics was almost unknown to the outside world, the design engineer won a bronze medal in the 100m sprint at the 1984 Paralympics, while also competing in other events such as wheelchair basketball. Taking up tennis when he retired, his passion was quickly transmitted to his daughter. \"I've always been close to my dad,\" says Whiley. \"Because he's got the same condition, he knows the excruciating pain that I can be in sometimes. \"And he's still a pretty cool dude. He just doesn't seem to get any older and he's got all the latest tennis gear.\" Just as Keith is her hero, Whiley could easily go on to become an inspirational figurehead for a young generation of emerging athletes - disabled or otherwise. Whiley admits she could have been a bit of a rebel had she not taken up sport, but is now wise beyond her 22 years and travels all over the world. \"I'm proof that you should never give up on your dreams. You can do anything if you put your mind to it,\" she says, smiling. If you have a disability and want to get into sport,", "question": "The first time Jordanne Whiley played tennis was in Israel .

He appeared in more than 30 films, including three Beatles movies. Sir Paul spoke about Spinetti's \"wit and exuberant personality\". The former Beatle struck up a friendship with the Welshman during filming for the first Beatles film, A Hard Day's Night. \"Victor was a fine man, a great pal and a fantastic actor and someone I am proud to have known for many years,\" said Sir Paul. \"His irreverent wit and exuberant personality will remain in my memory forever. \"I will miss his loyal friendship, as will all the others who were lucky enough to know and love the wonderful Mr Spinetti.\" Spinetti died at a hospice in Monmouth on Monday morning, said his agent Barry Burnett. \"He had cancer for a year, but he was very cheerful to the end,\" said Mr Burnett. \"I spoke to him on Friday and he was talking about his plans and everything.\" News of his death prompted a stream of tributes from fans and members of the entertainment world on Twitter. Barbara Windsor, a lifelong friend and co-star in Oh! What a Lovely War, had visited Spinetti last Thursday. \"We were very close. He was another of my great friends from that era. He was such a great man,\" she said. \"We just chatted and chatted and talked about old things. But he said, 'let's not talk about all that, let's talk about the future'.\" Actor Rob Brydon tweeted: \"So sad Victor Spinetti has died. The funniest story teller I've ever met and a lovely warm man. Proud to have been his friend. 'Eh, Vic...'\" Britt Ekland, actor, wrote: \"Just heard my wonderful friend, co writer and director Victor Spinetti died. Am devastated to have lost a true acting genius.\" Welsh actor Sian Phillips told BBC Wales she was shocked and saddened, adding: \"He was such a force of joy and vitality. When one saw him across a crowded room, one couldn't wait to get together with him and have a chat and a catch-up.\" Spinetti was born in the living quarters above the chip shop his family owned in Cwm, Ebbw Vale. He attended Monmouth School and initially had ambitions to be a teacher. But after turning to acting he studied at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Cardiff. His early stage career saw him make a number of memorable performances with Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, whose production of Oh, What a Lovely War! transferred to the West End and Broadway. It was his Tony-winning performance in Oh, What a Lovely War! that prompted the Beatles to ask him to appear in A Hard Day's Night (1964), the first of the group's five films. Spinetti's collaboration with the Beatles saw him appear in their next two productions, Help! (1965) and the hour-long television film Magical Mystery Tour (1967). He also worked with John Lennon to turn the Beatle's book, In His Own Write, in to a play which he then directed at the National Theatre. As well as the Beatles movies, Spinetti's film career included Zeffirelli's The Taming of the Shrew and a version of Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood, both alongside Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Spinetti's television roles included voicing the arch villain character Texas Pete in the S4C animated series SuperTed. He was also a noted raconteur whose creative output included poetry, an autobiography and his one-man show, A Very Private Diary.

Guillermin's action-packed 1976 version of King Kong, starred Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange. He died on Sunday at his home in the Topanga Canyon area of Los Angeles, his friend Nick Redman confirmed. In a statement, Guillermin's wife Mary called him \"sensitive and passionate, full of a fierce rapture himself.\" Born in London to French parents, Guillermin attended the University of Cambridge before joining the Royal Air Force. His career directing began in France with documentary film-making. In 1950, he moved to Hollywood to study film-making methods. Following the success of disaster films such as Airport and The Poseidon Adventure, Guillermin assembled a star-studded cast for The Towering Inferno. The movie, still regarded as a classic of the genre, about a fire that breaks out on the 81st floor of a shoddily-built skyscraper starred McQueen and Newman - two of the biggest film stars of the day. Known for his big budget adventures, Guillermin also had a reputation of being a difficult man to work with. In his memoirs, film editor Ralph E Winters, described an incident he witnessed when he worked with Guillermin on King Kong. In the screening room, Winters said a frustrated Guillermin kicked the seat in front until it broke. He received  an apologetic phone call the next day. In his 1995 autobiography, Charlton Heston, who worked with the director on 1972's Skyjacked, described him as having an \"irascible streak\". For 1978's adaptation of Agatha Christie's Death on the Nile, Guillermin assembled a cast of top acting talent.

{"article": "Whether for team building, forward planning, or to raise money for charity, the thought of such organised days away from the office can make even the bravest shudder. And it is hard to know what is worse - being forced to do something wacky, or having to sit in the conference room of a dreary hotel  for hours on end while your boss drones on about the year ahead. Thankfully for the sanity of middle managers everywhere, a new type of business away day is now increasingly on the menu - team-building cookery classes. So instead of having to try to keep up with Tim from accounting on a space hopper, or build a raft with Karen from HR, an office team or department will make a meal together in a professional kitchen. London-based Food@Work is one firm that organises such away days. Launched in 2002, it faced some tough trading in 2008 during the global financial crisis, but says business is now growing strongly again. Founder and owner Robinne Collie, 44, says there is not a \"usual month\" at the company, which charges from Â£125 per person. \"Some months we do one very large event, like a charity event we ran for 500 participants, or we can run up to six smaller events with 12 to 40 participants. \"I don't do more than six a month ever. I prefer four at most, because it's crazy busy.\" A recent customer of Food@Work was UK building products group SIG, which sent along a team to cook a three-course meal of twice-baked cheese souffles, roulade of chicken in a Madeira jus, and apple tartlets with a salted caramel sauce. \"It was a frantic few hours of fun in the kitchen,\" says Duncan Longson, SIG's European financial controller. \"It was great to experience the atmosphere of a professional kitchen, and an excellent team-building exercise.\" Peter Hallard, SIG's group talent and development director, adds: \"The heat of the professional kitchen and the stress of making a souffle stretched even the most seasoned of senior executives.\" Another business that offers team-building cookery classes for corporate clients is Waffle Workshop, which is based in Brussels. Founded in 2015 by Titch Fauconnier, the 29-year-old was originally targeting the tourism market, but decided to add corporate events after visitor numbers to the Belgian capital fell sharply last year following the bomb attack at the city's airport. Waffle Workshop now organises two or three two-hour team building events per month, with up to 29 participants taking part each time, at a cost of 28 euros per person ($30; Â£24). Mr Fauconnier says that attendees \"discover another side of the people they work with\". At the beginning he says he worried that those attending the corporate events would be reluctant to participate because it wasn't their choice to be there, but he says that his fears were soon proved to be wrong. \"After hosting many of these team-building events I have never experienced a lack of motivation from participants. They were always happy to do something out of the office,\" says Mr Fauconnier. In France, L'Atelier des Sens is one of the largest providers of cookery classes for corporate clients. Such events now make up 60% of its annual turnover of 2.5m euros. The business holds up to 150 team-building classes each month, with groups of typically 20 people cooking three-course meals at three venues in Paris, and one in Lyon. It uses 50 professional chefs to lead the events. Founder and owner Natacha Burtinovic, 42, says what is particularly interesting is the fact that \"sometimes the hierarchy that exists at work does not exist in our kitchens\". Back at Food@Work, which now uses up to 26 professional chefs to run the classes, Ms Collie says that running the events for 15 years has turned her into a keen kitchen-based psychologist. She says: \"Naturally organised people keep a clean workbench, and are clear on what they are doing, the task to follow. \"Process orientated people read recipes... while some people are so motivated by results and getting the job done quickly that they fail to get it done right. \"We have seen it all - shock, horror, fear, delight, some people wanting to run away, some wanting to get stuck in immediately.\" But what do the experts think? Lisa Lyons, a human resources boss at consultancy group Mercer, says that like any team-building event, cookery classes \"have the potential to accelerate the overall performance of the team\". However, Ms Lyons cautions that team-building events should be \"integrated as part of a longer-term approach to developing the team\". In other words, a company cannot hold a one-off cooking day - or visit an assault course - and then expect to have a harmonious and successful workplace forever after.", "question": "If you have ever been forced to race your boss around an assault course , or pass a beach ball to a colleague without using your @placeholder , then you have probably sampled the horror of a company away day .", "option_0": "generations", "option_1": "head", "option_2": "body", "option_3": "collection", "option_4": "hands", "label": 4}
{"article": "The prospect of losing a vital source of income would force Mexico into a \"one-time payment\" of $5-10bn (Â£3.5-7bn), says Mr Trump. But US President Barack Obama said the plan was \"half-baked\" and unworkable. Mr Trump made his remarks as voters in Wisconsin go the polls to pick their presidential candidates in each party. The vote could reshape the Republican race, with front-runner Mr Trump, who has never held elected office, facing a strong challenge from Texas Senator Ted Cruz. In a memo to the Washington Post, the businessman says he would threaten to change a law to cut off cash transfers. Building a border wall with Mexico has been a core message of Mr Trump's campaign since day one, when he said there were rapists, drug addicts and criminals coming across the border. If Donald Trump isn't the 2016 Republican presidential nominee - if some time between now and the end of the party convention in late July the prize slips from his grasp, Wisconsin could be where it all started to go awry. At this point it's conventional wisdom that Mr Trump has had a terrible week on the campaign trail. His top aide was indicted for accosting a reporter. He stumbled when trying to answer questions about abortion, angering both the left and the right. Wisconsin's popular Republican Governor Scott Walker endorsed his opponent, Ted Cruz. And Mr Trump saw his lead in this pivotal mid-western state evaporate. By Sunday evening, at a rally in a half-full downtown Milwaukee theatre, the front-runner was showing signs of frustration. He mocked his opponents in the #neverTrump movement, which has vowed to fight the New Yorker to the July Republican convention and beyond. Is it all going wrong for Trump in Wisconsin? The wall plan has been widely condemned by, among others, Pope Francis. Mr Trump has also pledged to deport all 11 million undocumented migrants. The Mexican central bank said that money sent home from overseas hit nearly $24.8bn last year, more than its oil revenues. In dismissing the plan, Mr Obama said it would cause the Mexican economy to collapse, sending even more migrants north to find work in the US. \"This is another example of something that's not thought through and put forward for political consumption,\" he said. The law Mr Trump wishes to change, as outlined in his memo, is part of the US Patriot Act - he would stop anyone living illegally in the US from sending money overseas. Just the threat of enacting this would make Mexico \"immediately protest,\" the Trump memo reads, and they would be compelled to pay for the wall. He also proposed raising visa fees and cancelling visas for Mexicans. If Mr Cruz wins in Wisconsin, as polls suggest, it will help him close the gap on Mr Trump in the all-important delegate count. Delegates represent their states at the party's convention in July and are accumulated by the votes in each state. A Wisconsin defeat would make it is far less likely that Mr Trump will have the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination. If he falls short, his unpopularity with sections of his party means he could be deprived of the nomination at the summer convention. Currently, Mr Trump has 735 delegates, Mr Cruz 461 and Ohio Governor John Kasich 143. Democratic voters are also voting in Wisconsin, with Hillary Clinton facing a strong challenge from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders after his string of wins.", "question": "Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump has said he would stop cash sent home by Mexicans @placeholder in the US , until the country pays for a border wall .", "option_0": "forces", "option_1": "control", "option_2": "based", "option_3": "staying", "option_4": "side", "label": 2}

A permanent fund will be set up to bolster the euro in times of crisis, and the EU will have extra powers of scrutiny over national budgets. A 2.9% limit on the EU budget increase was also agreed, under UK pressure. But tough negotiations are expected with the European Parliament, which voted for a 5.9% rise. If no deal is reached by mid-November the 2011 budget will be frozen at the 2010 level. EU officials said the eurozone had almost collapsed during the Greek debt crisis in May because it lacked a rescue mechanism. Q&A: EU crisis mechanism EU budget: Where does your money go? Germany wants limited changes to the EU's Lisbon Treaty to reinforce the changes, but is facing resistance from other countries. The leaders will return to Brussels in December, hoping to agree upon any revision, which it is hoped will be ratified in all EU countries by mid-2013. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister David Cameron won backing for his battle against a 5.9% rise in the EU budget. Germany and France were among 10 nations supporting Mr Cameron's attempt to limit the budget increase to 2.9% - a rise that would still cost UK taxpayers roughly Â£435m (500m euros). \"Now we have agreed that the EU budget must reflect what we're doing in our own countries,\" Mr Cameron said, describing the deal as \"incredibly important\". He will have further talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at his Chequers residence on Saturday. The bigger prize for Mr Cameron would be a deal to keep the UK's hard-won budget rebate, as difficult talks loom on the EU budget period beyond 2013. The BBC's Jonty Bloom, in Brussels, says the new crisis mechanism is designed to force a country to put its house in order long before its economic problems threaten the eurozone. Under the rules, EU officials will warn governments about property and speculative bubbles, and will be able to impose stringent fines on countries that borrow and spend too much. The permanent crisis fund will replace a temporary one, worth 440bn euros, which expires in 2013. It was created earlier this year to bail out Greece and support the euro. Cameron's EU budget battleUK wins allies in EU budget spat But Germany has argued that the Lisbon Treaty will have to be amended to make the emergency fund permanent and legally watertight. The current treaty contains a clause banning members from bailing each other out. Chancellor Merkel said all the leaders agreed that creating a permanent crisis mechanism \"will require a limited treaty change\". It took almost a decade of hard negotiations and two referendums in the Republic of Ireland to ratify the Lisbon Treaty, and many states are reluctant to make a move which could trigger a similar process. The EU Constitution - the treaty's ill-fated forerunner - was rejected by voters in France and the Netherlands. Mr Van Rompuy has been tasked with finding out whether the fund can be set up without each of the 27 member states having to ratify the treaty all over again. The UK says a mechanism to ensure stability in the eurozone is desirable - and that the planned sanctions would not apply to the UK. But all 27 member states' budgets will come under close scrutiny in a \"peer review\" process. There would be escalating sanctions on countries which overshot the maximum debt level allowed under the EU's Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which is 60% of GDP. Sanctions would kick in earlier than is the case under the current SGP, enabling the EU to take preventive action, for example against a country with an unsustainable housing bubble, or with mounting debt that undermines its competitiveness.", "question": "EU leaders say tough new budget rules agreed at their summit in Brussels will protect the euro from a future Greek - @placeholder debt crisis .", "option_0": "style", "option_1": "bulgarian", "option_2": "growing", "option_3": "signature", "option_4": "tank", "label": 0}

In May 1940, with the north-east corner of France cut-off by Hitler's army, 400,000 soldiers waited on the beaches for ships to take them to England - 200,000 British troops, 130,000 French and about 10,000 Belgians made it to safety, 60,000 did not. Operation Dynamo was a coordinated effort by naval ships, pleasure steamers from British seaside resorts - and small motor yachts, most of which had been commandeered by the Royal Navy for the evacuation. These \"little ships\", as they came to be known, had such shallow draught they were able to cross the sandbanks off Dunkirk and shuttle troops off the beach to larger ships anchored in deep water offshore. Most of the buildings in Dunkirk were destroyed by wartime bombardment, so the street scenes in the film were shot in Malo-les-Bains. In that shipping container in the park, I met three young boys who had dropped their bikes on to the grass outside to go in and watch the slideshow about the making of the film. One of them had seen the film - \"It's very good\" - and all three knew about the little ships. Theo, Gael and Mael - aged between 11 and 13 - answered me almost in unison when I asked why the little ships were important. \"For Operation Dynamo - to get the soldiers off the beach and take them to England,\" they said. In the first week of its release, 15,000 people saw the film on one of Dunkirk's three main screens, and it was showing at two other cinemas in the town. Across France, nearly a million watched it over the same period, making it the box-office number one. There are posters and banners advertising the film all over Dunkirk, and banners recalling Operation Dynamo. A telephone engineer and keen reader of World War Two history, Evrard Sebastien, offered a mixed review of the movie. \"It's an average film,\" he said. \"It won't win any Oscars. It was a good idea to make it, but I was disappointed. \"The action sequences with the ships and the planes are very well done.\" But, he added: \"There are many missing details. There are hardly any French soldiers in it. And it was thanks to them to a significant extent that the British were able to evacuate at all.\" For example, a seldom mentioned detail is that about 40,000 men in the French First Army delayed German progress towards Dunkirk from Lille, 80km (50 miles) to the south, where they eventually ran out of food and ammunition and were forced to surrender. Gregory and Juliette Lefevre - she is a secondary school teacher, he sells industrial equipment - were more enthusiastic about the film:  \"Very good, very emotional. We really like it. Fantastic film.\" But they too were concerned that there was barely any reference to the French in the film. Another Dunkirk woman who had seen the film, Isabelle Denele, said there was still a strong seam of gratitude in the town for Operation Dynamo. She said: \"The British had the courage to come and rescue their compatriots - that was magnificent. And, happily, the English were there to help us. \"And it's an effective film for me because my parents were here. \"They lived in Dunkirk at the time of the evacuation and then lived under Nazi occupation. \"My parents had to learn German. They're in their 90s now, and they can still speak German, and they don't like it. \"My parents, my grandparents, were marked by that war. They lost a lot of friends. Dunkirk suffered a lot in that war.\" Her husband, Bruno, expressed his gratitude with an unexpected comment about the revered French wartime leader in exile in London, who later became French president - Gen Charles de Gaulle. Bruno believes the Dunkirk evacuation - inspired by the British wartime leader Winston Churchill - was an essential precursor to the D-Day landings four years later, which helped to save France from the Nazis. \"De Gaulle would have been nothing without Churchill,\" he said. On the blustery July day that I visited the beach at Dunkirk, it was almost silent - and mostly deserted apart from some dog walkers and a few children making sandcastles. Out to sea, sailing boats glided along - their sails sharply white against dark clouds in the distance - a peaceful scene, where it was hard to imagine the terror on this Dunkirk beach 77 years ago when 400,000 troops were under bombardment by German planes as they lined up to board ships to take them to safety.", "question": "Christopher Nolan 's film about British , French and Belgian troops @placeholder the beaches and harbour at Dunkirk , in Operation Dynamo , in 1940 , has been this summer 's box - office hit - in the UK , in America and in France .

{"article": "Greg Anderson, 54, killed Luke Batty in front of shocked onlookers at a cricket oval in Tyabb, a Melbourne suburb. They had been playing together during an access visit in February when Anderson suddenly struck his son with a cricket bat and stabbed him. The coroner will examine what the authorities could have done differently to have prevented Luke's death. Anderson was shot by police after threatening them with a knife when they tried to detain him. He died later in hospital. The very public killing of the young boy shocked the nation in a way that many other acts of family violence committed every week in Australia have not. His death and his mother's emergence as an articulate and powerful advocate for the rights of women and children living in violent relationships have given new force to efforts to prevent domestic violence both in Victoria and the rest of the country. \"When this is all over, I still won't get my little boy back,\" Rosie Batty, Anderson's estranged former partner, told the court. \"I never want anyone to be sitting where I'm sitting and lose their son like I lost mine.\" Ms Batty's powerful campaigning on the issue since has attracted a nomination for Australian of the Year. One leading academic recently said Ms Batty had put domestic violence at the top of the political agenda in a way that decades of research had not managed. In Victoria, it is a key campaign issue for all political parties ahead of that state's 29 November election. At Monday's inquiry, a large photograph of Luke was beside Ms Batty on the witness stand as she outlined the multiple interactions she had had in recent years with police, courts and child protection that ultimately failed to prevent Anderson from murdering their son. Ms Batty did not speak directly to the media but had said ahead of the inquest that she wanted it to uncover the \"systematic failings\" which she believes occurred in the lead-up to Luke's death. At times quietly breaking down, Ms Batty detailed how she had considered calling the police when she had seen Anderson earlier on the night he killed Luke, knowing he had a number of outstanding warrants for his arrest, mostly related to threats he had made against her. She decided not to for Luke's sake. She had done so on two previous occasions but it had been \"traumatic, stressful, unpredictable\". She knew also the police had Anderson's address and could arrest him more \"discreetly\". \"I looked at Luke and thought this is going to be the third time I've tried to have this man arrested in front of Luke and his friends.\" She said she felt relief in April 2013 when a magistrate had ordered that Anderson have no further contact with Luke but that order was later changed to allow him limited access at sports practice. Federation of Community Legal Centres policy adviser Dr Chris Atmore said Ms Batty's evidence showed \"how much we put onto abused women to basically wrangle the system by themselves\". \"There were so many points in the system she articulated today where she was expected to blow the whistle for Greg, deal with her concerns for Luke, navigate the court system, interact with police and child protection. \"What came across in a striking way is how much we expect of people in Rosie's situation.\"", "question": "A coroner 's inquiry into the killing of an 11 - year - old boy by his father has @placeholder in Victoria , Australia .", "option_0": "fallen", "option_1": "appeared", "option_2": "exploded", "option_3": "doubled", "option_4": "opened", "label": 4}
{"article": "A new study has revealed the origins of 45,000 surnames, shedding light on our ancestors' jobs, what they looked like and where they lived. Researchers at the University of the West of England spent more than six years trawling through our family names, from the run-of the-mill Joneses and Smiths to the rarer Twelvetrees and Farahs. The full list will be published in the Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland, which at Â£400 is unlikely to make it to your bookshelf, but will be available in some public libraries. Here, we reveal the stories behind some of Britain's best-known names - and whether a surname can really affect how you go about your life. It's likely that your surname is based on one of four things, including: \"A Scottish name lots of people know is Cameron,\" said Dr Harry Parkin, one of the authors of the study. \"It is Scottish Gaelic in origin and means something like crooked nose or bent nose.\" The X Factor's Simon Cowell is no stranger to argument, having recently told fellow judge Nicole Scherzinger to \"shut up\" while on air. By way of excuse, Cowell's surname hints at possible warmongering origins. Cowell can derive from the Gaelic Mac Cathmhaoil, which literally means a \"son of battle chief\". I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! contestant Larry Lamb's name could come from the Irish word \"Luan\", meaning hound or warrior - no doubt a useful trait in the jungle. Rinder is one of the rarer surnames with violent connotations. It is a variation of Render, meaning \"to tear, to lacerate, to butcher\" in Middle English - perhaps a reflection of Judge Rinder's moves on Strictly Come Dancing.. The origin of celebrity couple Louise and Jamie Redknapp's surname, however, doesn't quite match their glamorous lifestyle. Roughly translating as a \"red-haired servant boy\", Redknapp - which can also mean hill - is one of 8,000 names included in the study that has not appeared in previous dictionaries. You're most likely to live next door to a family of Smiths, according to the study. With 500,000 bearers of the name today, Smith is the most common surname in Britain and Ireland, alongside: Did Linda Dunk choose to be an underwater photographer because of her surname? Or, by the same token, Henry Sick train to be a doctor? \"Actual science and research is being done to back up this theory,\" says Frank Swain of New Scientist magazine. The idea that our name influences which job we choose has earned itself the term \"nominative determinism\" - coined by the late John Hoyland, who collected odd facts about science for the magazine. \"We've collected thousands of examples over the years,\" says Mr Swain. \"It became a trope that John and myself tried in vain to kill on uncountable occasions.\" Some names can even make us more prone to illness, according to research. The British Medical Journal found that patients named \"Brady\" were more likely to need a pacemaker, in a 2013 study of people in Dublin with the surname. They found a statistical link between the family name and medical term for a slow heart rate - Bradycardia. The authors of the dictionary are now attempting to find out the meaning of every name in the UK and Ireland. \"It's a subject of tremendous interest,\" Dr Parkin said.", "question": "\" What 's in a name ? \" asked Shakespeare 's Juliet of Romeo .

{"article": "The claim: The UK can make itself energy self-sufficient in renewables. Reality Check verdict: This is not the policy in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, which pledges to get 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030. Being self-sufficient and having all energy coming from renewables would require considerable development of storage technology to avoid having to use non-renewable sources or energy bought from overseas as back-up sources. It came after he had said: \"If it is simply for hair shirt, muesli-eating, Guardian readers to solve climate change... we're all stuffed.\" Becoming energy self-sufficient in renewables is not current Liberal Democrat policy, although Mr Farron described it in a speech in February as being a \"patriotic endeavour\". The manifesto says the party would: \"Expand renewable energy, aiming to generate 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030.\" A party spokeswoman described the leader's statement in the debate as \"visionary as opposed to completely literal\". The problem with being entirely self-sufficient is that many renewable sources of energy cannot generate power all of the time (the notable exception being the burning of biomass), so if you are using a very high proportion of renewables you rely on interconnectedness (buying electricity from another country where the wind is blowing), storage (batteries in the short-term, some sort of gas storage in the longer term) or a back-up system using gas-fired power stations or nuclear energy. The Liberal Democrat manifesto talks about investing in interconnectors, which would be unnecessary if the country was to become self-sufficient. There are already private plans in place to increase the amount of electricity that may be bought from France via interconnectors. It may be that when he said self-sufficient he meant that we should not have a trade deficit in energy, so it would be OK to buy energy from other countries when we needed it as long as we sold the same amount to other countries when they needed it. While there have been suggestions that marine energy could make the UK a net exporter of electricity, being self-sufficient and generating 100% of energy from renewables is considerably more challenging than, for example, 90%, mainly because of the challenges of storage. The development of a smart grid, which co-ordinates renewable energy supplies depending on demand, may also be needed for a 100% renewable system. Also, while the Liberal Democrat manifesto targets 60% of electricity, Mr Farron was talking about all energy, which means, for example, that all cars have to run on renewable energy and all buildings have to be heated by it. So in 2016, the UK generated 24.4% of its electricity from renewables, but in 2015 (the latest year available) it was only producing 8.8% of energy from renewables. The UK has an obligation under European Union rules to derive 30% of electricity from renewables by 2020, which it is on the way to achieving (although the UK is currently scheduled to have left the EU by then). But the other two parts of the targets are 12% of heat and 10% of transport to be powered by renewables, which we are less likely to achieve. The Labour manifesto pledges to get 60% of energy from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030. The Conservative manifesto looks at it in a different way, saying that \"energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the means by which we reach our objectives\". So they say that the focus will not be on how the energy is generated but on achieving, \"reliable and affordable energy, seizing the industrial opportunity that new technology presents and meeting our global commitments on climate change\". The Green Party would have a target of near-100% renewable electricity generation by 2030 with significant investment in electric vehicles and lower-carbon sources of heating. It supports self-sufficiency and a decentralised system of communities owning their own generation systems, but would also invest in interconnectors to allow for co-operation with other countries.

{"article": "On Tuesday, Pope Francis will open the original Holy Door at St Peter's Basilica in Rome, the first time it has been opened since the turn of the century, to mark the official start of a year laden with symbolism for Catholics across the world. So what does it mean? The clue to the aim of the Year of Mercy is in its name: a time for the Church itself and for Catholics everywhere to show mercy and compassion, in thought and in deed, and focus on forgiveness, reconciliation and doing good in concrete ways for the needy and those on the margins of society. The crossing of the threshold of a Holy Door is a sign of spiritual renewal, and the passage from sin to grace. Pope Francis has long signalled his wish to change the Church's approach from condemnation of wrongdoing to a Church more forgiving of its flock, and more understanding of the difficulties faced by believers today. This extraordinary jubilee year is a practical way of giving expression to that wish, and creating a Church that is a \"field hospital\", healing and binding the wounds of its flock. Announcing the extraordinary jubilee this March, the Pope said: \"The greater the sin, the greater the love the Church must express,\" writing that the Holy Door is a \"Door of Mercy, through which anyone who enters will experience the love of God who consoles, pardons and instils hope.\" Pope Francis took many by surprise when he announced earlier this year that as part of the jubilee, all parish priests across the world would be allowed to absolve repentant women who asked for forgiveness for having an abortion, even though Church teaching still terms abortion a grave sin. He has, in effect, already begun the jubilee by opening the Holy Door of the Cathedral in Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic, during his recent trip to Africa. It was one of many symbolic gestures he made in a nation torn by fighting between Christians and Muslims. The Pope has also made clear he wants this jubilee to open a year of \"fervent dialogue\" between Christians, Muslims and Jews, so that all who believe in a merciful God show more mercy towards one another, driving out violence, disrespect and discrimination. He said that the Christian profession of faith in God's mercy \"relates us to Judaism and Islam, both of which consider mercy to be one of God's most important attributes\". In a year marked by cruel conflicts, terrorist attacks and natural disasters across the globe, the jubilee is expected to draw millions of pilgrims to Rome, where the city authorities and the Vatican have been working together to ensure security. Italian security forces will be on high alert, while Rome has declared a no-fly zone for drones as well as regular aircraft, although Vatican officials say they had no knowledge of any specific or credible plot to attack the city or the Vatican. While  trusting in God, the Vatican has also invested in earthly technology, with visitors having to pass through metal detectors on St Peter's Square before they can enter. Jubilee years are rooted in the Old Testament tradition of freeing slaves and prisoners once every 50 years, a concept that died out within Judaism but was taken up by Pope Boniface VIII for the Catholic Church in 1300. Pilgrimages to Rome were at the heart of the original jubilee years, and attracted hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to the city, many willing to pay for \"indulgences\" - the eradication by the Church of the spiritual debt arising from sin. It was a tradition that not only contributed copious cash to the Vatican's coffers, but also contributed to the theological turmoil that led to the establishment of rival Protestant churches across much of northern Europe. The last Jubilee was called by St John Paul II to mark the millennium, and this Holy Year of Mercy starts on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December 2015 and will end on the Feast of Christ the King on 20 November 2016. In an innovation by Pope Francis, Holy Doors will also be opened this year at cathedrals, some churches and shrines around the world for those unable to make the pilgrimage to Rome. In England, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, will open the Holy Door at Westminster Cathedral, while Holy Doors will also be opened in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and many churches will hold special services on Sunday to mark the start of the jubilee.", "question": "Appropriately for the weeks of Advent leading up to Christmas , carpenters and other tradespeople have been kept busy in the run -up to the Jubilee Holy Year of Mercy , installing or ensuring that the Holy Doors , due to be opened at Roman Catholic cathedrals and churches across the world , are safe and @placeholder .", "option_0": "warned", "option_1": "functioning", "option_2": "show", "option_3": "neck", "option_4": "witnessing", "label": 1}

For once on English soil, Wladimir Klitschko was in control. Which is how he likes it. A dignified man, Klitschko doesn't look comfortable exchanging barbs with a 6ft 7in Batman. Then again, who does? A 6ft Robin? But in Anthony Joshua, Klitschko has a rival he can understand. Someone safe, just like him. At one point during his customary press conference monologue - the Ukrainian often swats away questions as if they are bothersome flies - Klitschko looked across at Joshua and said: \"We are friends.\" It sounded like a Jedi mind trick. Promoter Eddie Hearn had already warned Joshua not to be fooled. \"Joshua must not fall into that friendly-friendly trap,\" said Hearn after his charge's three-round demolition of Eric Molina on Saturday. \"He has to have that same ruthless streak he's had until now. He will, because he's a ruthless individual.\" Joshua didn't sound too ruthless, reflecting on the challenge ahead. He didn't sound too anything in particular. In fact, he made defending his world heavyweight crown against the former king in front of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium sound like a four-rounder at the Goresbrook Leisure Centre in Dagenham. When it was gently suggested that Klitschko - perhaps, just maybe - had been a little bit disrespectful by referring to him as his \"little bro\", Joshua - gently, respectfully - disagreed. \"It's fine. I let it go over my head. It's all irrelevant.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Joshua even felt the need to downgrade his one quote that might have sounded a tad big-headed, insisting that victory over Klitschko would not, as he had previously stated, make him an \"overnight legend\" but would be merely the first act in creating a great legacy. In chess terms, it was moving a piece backwards. What will sell the fight is not needle and trash-talk but the question of timing. It is a classic clash of generations, between a youthful, unproven king and a battle-hardened ruler from a previous age. Has Joshua, a pro for barely three years and with 18 fights to his name, learnt enough? Or has Klitschko, a man with 64 wins from 68 pro fights and a two-time world champion, amassed too much wisdom? Will the 27-year-old Joshua have too much hunger and too much athleticism for a man 14 years his senior? Did Klitschko's chastening defeat by Tyson Fury in Dusseldorf last November, which brought to an end his second, nine-year reign, show that he was past it? Can Joshua take his power? Can the Englishman go past seven rounds, as he has never done before? Is he in the same class as Fury? For his part, Klitschko believes his year and a half out of the ring - two scheduled rematches against Fury fell through because of injuries and the Manchester fighter's struggles with mental illness - have refreshed him. \"My brother [Vitali, the former twice heavyweight world champion] said a four-year break was good for him,\" said Klitschko. \"It sounds like I'm really old but I don't feel this way. I was not sitting back, drinking beer and doing nothing.\" Two training camps for fights that never happened might have kept him active but there are times when Klitschko's thinking sounds wishful, as when he insists that both his hands and his reflexes have become faster with age. Before the wily Fury rendered Klitschko almost punchless, there were clear signs of deterioration when he fought unheralded American Bryant Jennings. And if Klitschko really is speeding up after 40, he's a scientific miracle. However, it is entirely possible that nine years of largely one-side victories dulled the senses, imperceptibly. Between regaining a portion of the world heavyweight crown in 2006 and losing it to Fury, Klitschko made 18 defences, as many as Joshua has had pro fights. All that winning can become mundane. \"The Fury defeat woke me up,\" said Klitschko, who has had 27 world title fights in total. \"After so many years I realised I was not as motivated. \"Maybe it sounds crazy, but it was good that I lost that fight and good that I'm the underdog for this one. It's nice being the challenger again. I have an adrenaline rush in my blood. I've been missing it. This time I'm obsessed.\" Klitschko and Joshua sparred 20 rounds at the former's Austrian bolthole in 2014, before Klitschko's five-round knockout of Bulgaria's Kubrat Pulev. Both men will have learnt a thing or two, but not nearly enough. \"Klitschko didn't perform against Fury so when he says he's obsessed, that's him saying he wants to show people how good he actually is,\" said Joshua, who won Olympic super-heavyweight gold in 2012, 16 years after Klitschko. \"They say he didn't throw enough punches against Fury. Believe me, he will throw punches against me. If he wins, he will say: 'I'm still the big bro.' But if he loses he will realise that the torch has changed hands, that this is a completely different era. And after that, I want to be doing it for years. \" Some have suggested that Joshua-Klitschko isn't as big or as relevant as both camps would like us to believe, because Fury is the main man. But their point is largely irrelevant. Fury briefly had it all but was forced to abdicate. He owns no world titles, he currently has no boxing licence, he might never fight again. In time, some of us might even miss the edge he brought to the heavyweight division. But for now, let's just appreciate some plain old boxing.

{"article": "\"It's like living in a ridiculous police drama,\" Sue Beere says. Her husband Jonathan Beere is serving 24 years in a high-security prison in the Midlands, convicted of organising a complex operation to smuggle a quarter of a tonne of cocaine into the UK. She vividly remembers the day police came to arrest him in January 2011: \"They literally came through the door in the morning... a troop of men.\" All she could think was that they had made \"some stupid mistake\" over his identity, and found the wrong man. She says local police stopped to comfort her young son, saying: \"Don't cry nipper, be brave, daddy will be home tonight.\" But Jonathan Beere has not been back home since that day, and has so far served five years in jail. Find out more Watch video journalist Jim Reed's full film about this case on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmewebsite. Two of the other men, skipper Jamie Green and Zoran Dresic, also received 24-year sentences, while Daniel Payne received 18 years and Scott Birtwistle 14. They had been charged with conspiring to import Class A drugs. Now a new lawyer, Emily Bolton, is working on their case. She founded the Innocence Project New Orleans in the US, which has so far freed 25 prisoners, and has recently set up a new charity in the UK - the Centre for Criminal Appeals - to specialise in miscarriage of justice investigations. On 29 May 2010, a small fishing boat - the Galwad-Y-Mor - left the Isle of Wight on what the crew claim was a routine trip to catch lobster and crab in the Channel. That night, a large drugs operation led by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - known as Operation Disorient - was taking place, involving surveillance planes, a Border Agency patrol boat and police lookouts along the coast. The authorities had intelligence that cocaine was being smuggled to Europe from South America on giant cargo ships, such as the container vessel MSC Oriane - which was one of nine from Brazil that appeared to be of particular interest. At about midnight, the ship and the fishing boat briefly came close together - though exactly how close is disputed. The ship went on towards the European mainland, and the Galwad continued home, past Freshwater Bay - the western tip of the Isle of Wight. The next day, at this same bay, a member of the public spotted 11 sacks tangled around a buoy - each packed with a pure form of cocaine. The prosecution's case was that the sacks were pushed off the side of the container ship for the fishermen to retrieve from the sea, before taking them to the bay to hide or be picked up by another vessel. But Ms Bolton disputes this. \"What the police are alleging [is that the Galwad] was able to pinpoint and locate 11 bags of cocaine in the English Channel, in shipping lanes, in the middle of the night in a storm,\" she says. \"We think we now have the evidence proving this simply couldn't have taken place.\" At the trial, the prosecution relied on navigational data taken from on-board computers on the two vessels, which purported to show that - around midnight - the Galwad crossed the Oriane's wake. There would have been a short window for the 11 sacks of cocaine to be transferred to the fishing boat. However, Ms Bolton says the prosecution's expert witness left out key plot points and used damaged data. Her new analysis suggests the paths of the boats were never closer than 100m from one another, and that the sea's drift would have taken the drugs away from the fishermen's boat. \"If that intersection between the vessels never took place, there is no case,\" she says. The prosecution also points to a series of calls made to and from the satellite phone on the Galwad while it was in the Channel, suggesting someone on shore was co-ordinating the drugs drop. The defence said the timing was a coincidence and someone was just checking on the health of one of the other fishermen who was seasick - a migrant from Eastern Europe. No traces of cocaine were ever found on the fishing boat, despite it being searched with specialised equipment. The container ship, the Oriane, was also searched when it next touched British shores a few days later, but no trace of drugs was ever found. No-one on the Oriane was arrested. The Galwad spent 18 hours sailing back to its home port of Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight. On the way it stopped for about an hour in Freshwater Bay - its crew say to fish for mackerel. That evening, the first arrests were made. At this point though, the drugs had not been discovered. This happened the following day, when a member of the public called to say he had spotted 11 multicoloured bags floating in Freshwater Bay. This timeframe, Ms Bolton says, was crucial. At the time the fishing boat was said to have hidden the drugs in Freshwater Bay, two officers from Hampshire police were watching from the cliff tops as part of the police operation. In the officers' logs before the drugs were found, they recorded someone on the fishing boat throwing six or seven items overboard at intervals - which the fishermen say could have been rubbish bags full of old bait. But the next day, after the drugs were discovered, the police lookouts changed the official log - as they are allowed to do - to clarify what they saw. In the new version they reported 10 to 12 items the size of a holdall, tied together in a line and deployed from the boat followed by a red floating buoy - a description that almost exactly matched the drugs that were picked up by the police boat. The two police surveillance officers then told different accounts in court. One said he was convinced of the significance of the holdalls at the time; the other said he thought little of it until after the drugs were found the next day. As a result, the new defence team claims the accounts cannot be relied upon. \"These are officers that are trained to get the details right every single time - and we are not talking about small details,\" Ms Bolton explains. \"We are talking about big changes, about what they saw and also where they saw it from.\" At trial, both police lookouts were adamant they had seen 10 to 12 sacks thrown off the fishing boat along with a buoy. After making the first log entry, they said they had seen extra bags thrown off the boat, so the amended version was the full picture of everything they had recorded that day. The Independent Police Complaints Commission did look into the case and, though it found inconsistencies in the officers' evidence, decided it was not enough to show they had fabricated their accounts. Complaints against the two officers were dismissed. Hampshire Police also said they had no ongoing complaints relating to this investigation. Soca, now rebranded as the National Crime Agency (NCA), said at the time that the operation had stopped a huge amount of cocaine from reaching the streets of the UK. Ms Bolton's new evidence has been passed to the criminal cases review commission, which will decide if the five men can launch a fresh appeal. She believes there was a motive for Soca to implicate the five men. \"At this stage in the investigation it appears Operation Disorient really needed to get a result. They had committed a lot of resources to this investigation and needed someone to be responsible, and they started focusing on the fishing boat. \"From then on, they interpreted all evidence that came before them as pointing to guilt, and meanwhile ignored or didn't seek other evidence which pointed in the opposite direction.\" The NCA said it could not comment while that investigation was ongoing. Hampshire Police said: \"It would not be appropriate to comment on operational matters led by another agency [the NCA].\"", "question": "In 2011 , a group of men from the Isle of Wight was given a @placeholder 104 - year prison sentence for masterminding a £ 53 m drug smuggling operation .

{"article": "The girl suffered injuries including burns to her hands and feet, the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences has said. Police told the BBC the girl had worked for Islamabad judge Raja Khurram Ali Khan for the past two years. He has not yet commented. The case has caused a furore in Pakistan. Human rights groups say Pakistan's labour laws ignore the abuse of children who, from a young age, are working on the streets or in the homes of middle-class families. There are believed to be about 12 million child workers in Pakistan, many enduring unsafe or harsh conditions. Reports of the alleged abuse first surfaced on social media last month, along with pictures of the girl's injuries. Pakistan's mainstream media took up the story, after which the girl - whom the BBC is not naming - is said to have gone missing. Police are reported to have found her in a suburb of Islamabad on Sunday and taken her into protective custody. A report on the girl's injuries is to be submitted to the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Dr Tariq Iqbal, who heads the medical board, told reporters on Monday that she had \"some burns, some traumas, some lacerations, some blisters [on her body]\". \"We have documented all wounds and injuries in as much detail as possible, and have also given our opinion on the probable cause,\" he said.

{"article": "In Moscow there have been fewer election posters and banners on view than in previous years. Last week one Russian newspaper joked that the Duma election had been classified \"Top Secret\", since voters did not know the names of the candidates. And yet, in theory, this election should have been more exciting than previous polls. A change to the law has permitted more parties to participate than in 2011 and even a handful of Kremlin critics have been allowed to run. What's more, this time half of the 450 Russian MPs will be elected - not by party lists - but in single-mandate districts: the return to a system in which Russians can vote for a candidate of their choice in their own constituency. However, the timing of this vote has kept public interest low. The Duma election had been scheduled for December. Instead the authorities brought it forward by three months, closer to the summer. As a result, Russians have been more concerned with holidays, harvesting fruits and vegetables on their allotments and preparing for the new school year than with electing a new Duma. But why the date change? How might the Kremlin benefit from a September, rather than a December, vote? Kremlin critics claim the aim was to ensure that urban populations - traditionally, more critical of the government - had less time in which to mobilise for the election. A lower turnout is widely believed to benefit the ruling party. President Putin will want the new Duma to be just as pro-Kremlin as previous incarnations. Even if the party of power - United Russia - fails to achieve an outright majority, the three other main \"systemic opposition\" parties (the Communists, Just Russia and the Liberal Democratic Party) should secure enough support to ensure the Duma remains, to a large extent, a Kremlin rubber stamp. But this time, the Kremlin needs a parliament, which is more than just a rubber stamp. It needs a Duma which is seen by the people to be a legitimate institution. The 2011 parliamentary vote was followed by anti-government street protests across Russia, sparked by what was widely perceived to have been large-scale electoral fraud: a rigged election in favour of United Russia. The protests were the biggest challenge Vladimir Putin had faced, although they waned after a Kremlin crackdown and differences among the opposition. To head off protests this time, the Kremlin will be keen to ensure this election is not tainted by accusations of vote-rigging. Hence, the changes to the election law, the inclusion of some opposition candidates, as well as the appointment of a respected human rights advocate, Ella Pamfilova, to head the Central Election Commission. That does not mean the current electoral process is beyond criticism - as I have suggested, the decision to change the date of the election appears an attempt to influence the result. Russia's economic problems make the need for legitimacy even more pressing. Eight years ago, the country's national reserve fund stood at $140bn (Â£105bn). Last week, Russia's deputy finance minister predicted the reserve would be exhausted in 2017. That means more difficulties in paying social benefits, pensions and the salaries of state employees. The government may have no choice soon but to embark on unpopular economic reforms. This has implications for the vertical system of power Vladimir Putin has constructed in Russia, with the president at the top and all other institutions - including parliament - below and subservient to him. That system worked while the economy was working. But the money is running out, social protest is on the rise. The danger for the Kremlin is that if Russians question the legitimacy of other institutions in their country - including their parliament - they pin all of their too many hopes on the one man at the top.", "question": "This Sunday 's parliamentary election is the eighth which I have witnessed or @placeholder on in Russia since 1989 .

Bailey, of Ynysybwl, Rhondda Cynon Taff, was jailed for 13 years after the pair were found guilty of conspiracy to rape. The offences came to light when the woman's partner found the texts. The court heard the pair exchanged dozens of messages and the woman also sent Bailey a naked picture of the girl and bought sleeping pills to drug her. At an earlier hearing, the woman admitted distributing five indecent images of a child and Bailey admitted possessing those images. The mother, described as \"vulnerable and gullible\" by recorder Eleri Rees QC, asked Bailey what she would get out of the plan to rape her daughter and he mentioned sums of Â£200 to Â£300. Judge Rees said Bailey was \"prolific\" in contacting a number of women on a dating website. An investigation discovered that he was having similar discussions with other women. The court heard the pair planned to rape the girl during the Whitsun school holiday and talked about drugging her. Judge Rees said that despite speaking to her doctor, who advised against giving a child sleeping tablets, the mother went ahead and bought some online. \"By your own admission you tried it out a week before the rape was due to take place,\" she added.

{"article": "Hungary will propose that each of the 28 EU members pays 1% of its income from the Union, plus 1% of its contributions to it, into a special fund. In Hungary's case, that would amount to â‚¬1bn (Â£720m; $1.1bn). Close to 250,000 migrants have entered Hungary this year - 70,000 this month alone - and it has become a transit state on the Western Balkan route to Germany and other EU destinations. The government has tried to stop migrants coming by erecting a border fence and giving the army extra powers to keep them out. And, along with three other Central European states, Hungary has been outvoted on an EU quota plan for taking in another 120,000 refugees. The proposed special fund would be used, Mr Orban will argue, to improve conditions in the refugee camps in countries neighbouring Syria - especially Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan - and to bolster Europe's external borders. Orban: Europe's borders threatened by migrants Why EU deal on migrants is so tricky Why Central Europe says No The Hungarian plan rests on two premises. That European voters share his view that the ongoing influx would change Europe beyond recognition, if allowed to continue, and that they don't want that. And that if conditions improve where they are, the migrants will stay there, in the hope that they can one day rebuild Syria. The Hungarian prime minister clearly also hopes that the plan will prove his own fence-building approach right - that Europe should defend its borders first, before it even starts discussing quotas. He may also add that Hungary would be willing to accept a voluntary quota, if his proposal or parts of it are accepted. The Orban proposal may be too much, too late for other European leaders.

{"article": "The case has been taken by two same-sex couples who were the first people in the UK to enter civil partnerships in 2005. Their lawyer claimed they are suffering state discrimination as a result of the ban. Judgement was reserved after a two-day hearing at the High Court in Belfast. Grainne Close, Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane challenged Stormont as the only UK administration to ban same-sex marriage. Belfast was the first place in the UK to host civil partnership ceremonies when the law was introduced 10 years ago, but now Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK and Ireland that has not legalised same-sex marriage. The two couples took the judicial review proceedings, claiming that the ban breaches Article Eight of European Convention on Human Rights, by denying respect for their private and family lives. But a lawyer for Stormont's Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) told the court the ban was not a breach of human rights. He added that civil partnerships already met the minimum requirements set out under human rights law. He told the court that recent rulings from the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights supported the view that no significant breach has occurred. Last month, in the fifth Stormont vote on the issue, MLAs backed the introduction of same-sex marriage for the first time, but the Democratic Unionist Party blocked it by deploying a mechanism requiring the proposal to achieve a cross-community majority. The barrister claimed claimed a court intervention could undermine devolution. \"It is live in the democratic process. The applicants may not be satisfied with the pace, outcomes or infrastructure but it cannot be deemed that it is not a live issue,\" he said. The judge heard the case tandem with a separate bid by two men who want their marriage in England to be recognised in their native Northern Ireland.

{"article": "Vast yellow fields surround this border town. But just across the border inside Syria, white and black plumes of smoke rise above Kobane as Islamic State attacks intensify. In the past two weeks, thousands of women have managed to escape IS and take refuge in Turkey, only a few kilometres from their own homes. Their children have been queuing to register for entry into a new country. With rucksacks strapped to their backs, they could be schoolchildren queuing to begin a new term, were it not for the tragic circumstances. One man carries bright yellow birds in two cages. It seems everyone's priorities differ when it comes to deciding what to take with them. On my first day in Suruc, I had hoped to be back home in Istanbul in a matter of days. But the plight of the refugees and the stories I heard kept me at the border. I realised I would be staying longer than I had expected. I met a man who had lost his leg to a landmine. He was trying to escape from IS when he stepped on it right on the Syria-Turkey border. Once agricultural land, the Turkish authorities had turned it into a vast minefield in the 1950s to prevent smuggling. The same day I met a 19-year-old female Syrian Kurd YPG fighter in the main hospital in Urfa. She told me she had been shot by an IS extremist in a ditch in a village near Kobane.  She had shot back. She looked devoid of emotion as she told her story, and I saw her eyes light up only when I asked her to tell me more about her village. One day at the border, a group of young Kurdish men were tear-gassed by Turkish police as they tried to get home to fight with the YPG. Most of them made it through. I then spoke to a woman nearby. Her name was Amira. She had three small children with her.  She was sitting on a rock, refusing to move, she said, until it was safe for her to return home. Her youngest boy was crying silently. That night, I heard there were American air strikes. Earlier, some of the Kurdish refugees and local residents had told me the air intervention filled them with hope. Others refused to believe the strikes had actually happened. \"It is all lies. No way were there any US air strikes near Kobane that night,\" they had told me. The next day some of the refugees went back across the border to Kobane. Still at the border, I remember one elderly woman in a purple dress, probably in her 70s.  She said she longed for home and wanted to die there.  She pointed at the small stones on at her feet. \"I sleep on this ground, just like these stones do. But I want to die in the comfort of my own bed.\" A few hours later at this same spot, I saw a hearse carrying the coffin of a dead fighter, who had been brought to Turkey for treatment after suffering injuries in the fighting in Kobane.  A terrible ending, I thought. In Suruc, a few days later, Hennan Muhammed told me how IS had taken his son hostage while he was travelling to Iraq to avoid being conscripted by Syria in the war. His son was an English literature graduate, just like me. Half way through my trip, a mortar shell landed near the TV satellite trucks stationed on the Turkish side of the border. Luckily no-one got hurt.  But the sound of it was unforgettable, so dangerous and so close. I filmed a piece-to-camera as safely as I could. When my recorded video appeared on the BBC Turkish website later that day, I did not post the link on Facebook so my mother would not find out and worry. Two weeks later, I am back home in Istanbul, hoping to be able to report happier news from the border if I return there. I hope the distressing sight of grey smoke rising above Kobane will have vanished.

{"article": "The Ozo features eight camera lenses and eight microphones on a spherical-shaped body, from which a handle protrudes. The Finnish firm said that one advantage over existing systems was that it created footage that could be watched in real time via a VR headset. One expert said Ozo was not as big a leap for the firm as it might seem. \"Nokia has a great deal of experience developing not only camera technology, but also the portability of camera technology,\" said Chris Green, a consultant at Davies Murphy Group. \"The company was putting in high-end cameras on very small mobile phones and producing exceptional image results years before other manufacturers. \"And it can now direct the knowledge it has to other sectors.\" Ozo was unveiled at an event in Los Angeles, underlining that the company plans to target it at Hollywood and other media professionals, rather than consumers. Nokia said the device was due to go on sale before the end of the year, but was unable to provide the full technical specifications or price. Nokia follows GoPro, Jaunt, Giroptic and Spherical in announcing a virtual reality recording device that is meant for \"prosumers\". The firm's pitch is that  Ozo can not only provide live monitoring of footage via a compatible headset, but also allow playback of filmed material at low resolution within minutes of it being shot. \"[It] removes the need to pre-assemble a panoramic image - a time-consuming process with solutions currently in the marketplace,\" the company said in a statement. One tech journalist who was given a preview of a prototype suggested the footage it produced was sometimes \"muddy and out of focus\" but praised the kit's audio-rendering capabilities. \"I found myself constantly looking around in each clip, because the sound seemed to track my position,\" wrote Casey Newton for the Verge. \"I would hear something behind me, and when I turned I would see the still-moving mouth of the person talking.\" Nokia also revealed that Jaunt would support its device, despite the Californian company offering a rival product of its own called Neo. Jaunt's investors include Britain's Sky TV and Google, and its president Cliff Plumer was an adviser to the Oculus VR headset's creators before they joined Facebook - making the firm well placed to capitalise on growing interest in VR. \"Our partnership with Nokia is another big step for us to continue to provide our partners with the most cutting-edge technology to further cater to their creative needs,\" said Mr Plumer. Virtual reality is unlikely to become Nokia's main business. Earlier this week, the European Union approved the company's 15.6bn euro ($17.2bn; Â£11bn) takeover of Alcatel-Lucent, which will let it extend its share of the telecoms network equipment market. But Mr Green said Ozo still had the potential to develop into a sizeable business. \"We know there is a market there - the fact VR cameras are already being used in professional film and TV production shows the importance they now have,\" he said. \"There's room for lots more growth, and it's a logical market for Nokia to dabble in.\"", "question": "Nokia is developing a virtual - reality @placeholder device that can record 360 - degree views and \" 3D audio \" .", "option_0": "dollar", "option_1": "body", "option_2": "capture", "option_3": "group", "option_4": "partnership", "label": 2}
{"article": "And yet, Spain has been without a proper government for more than 300 days and is well on the way towards Belgium's mind-numbing record of 541 days without a fully-fledged administration from June 2010 to December 2011. That's because politicians have repeatedly failed to agree on a new government since the first of two inconclusive general elections was held on 20 December 2015. In the words of Spanish analyst Francisco de Borja Lasheras: \"We are learning to be Belgium but the question remains whether the Spanish state can afford to be Belgium.\" \"We Spaniards are used to our politicians doing a botch job so such a situation is not completely unexpected,\" says Mario Perales, a 45-year-old civil servant from Madrid. And his view is largely shared by Spaniards: one recent poll suggested only 11.6% saw a lack of government as their biggest problem. So will the limbo last? Spain's Socialist party (PSOE) national committee meets on Sunday to decide whether to stand aside and allow caretaker Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to govern without a majority in parliament. If they don't, Spain's power vacuum rolls on towards a third national election, probably on 18 December. A caretaker government is a lame-duck government. Foreign and economic policy comes to a halt and lawmaking stops. Belgium's 541-day stalemate lasted from 13 June 2010 to 6 December 2011. Its borrowing costs soared and its credit score was cut. Spain has so far seen 10 months of limbo and two inconclusive votes, in December 2015 and June 2016. Both countries face a separatist challenge, from some Flemish parties in Belgium and Catalan groups in north-eastern Spain. Both are constitutional monarchies. Spain has seen six prime ministers since it returned to democratic rule in 1977, while Belgium has changed leader 12 times in the same period. Will Spain's lost months come to an end? Spain's Socialist leader resigns Belgium country profile For Spain's deadlock to end, the Socialists would have to agree to hold their noses, abstain in a confidence vote and let Mariano Rajoy return to power at the head of a centre-right government. His Popular Party (PP) government has been marked by corruption scandals and austerity measures. Allowing his return was too much to bear for Pedro Sanchez, who resigned as Socialist leader rather than let that happen. Tensions have run high between politicians, but the Spanish population has barely stirred. In Belgium, during the 18-month deadlock, protests included a shaving stoppage and even the suggestion of a sex strike by male politicians' wives. Not so in Spain. \"Spaniards are very tolerant on the whole, and our political bickering has not trickled down yet to the population,\" says Francisco de Borja Lasheras, from the European Council of Foreign Relations (ECFR). \"There are levels of government that are working perfectly well,\" he says, but warns that in the long term, Catalonia's drive towards independence and foreign challenges such as Brexit will need a proper government. The reality is that Spain is functioning, and largely thanks to its regions. Unlike Madrid's national parliament, almost all 17 regional governments which run health, education and other public services are formed by a variety of coalitions from across the political spectrum. But the national budget is the job of central government and no new policies can be drawn up for 2017. Although Spain's economy has maintained a steady pace of growth of just over 3% annually since early 2015, the budget deficit is still well above target. So this year's spending plan will be automatically rolled over. \"This means we cannot take on any new expense, reform or investment that is not already detailed in the rolled-over budget,\" a government spokesperson explains. The caretaker government had to secure the support of parliament to avoid EU sanctions on its 2016 deficit target. But there is no deal yet to reduce the deficit in 2017, as Brussels demands. The parties may be bickering nationally, but regionally it's a different story. Madrid's PP regional president, Cristina Cifuentes, signed an anti-corruption agreement to secure the support of the centrist Ciudadanos party in 2015, including an end to parliamentarians' immunity from prosecution. Andalucia's Socialist president, Susana Diaz, also made a deal with Ciudadanos. In Valencia, the government led by Socialist Ximo Puig, backed by anti-austerity parties Compromis and Podemos, budgeted a record â‚¬13.3 (Â£11.9bn; $14.5bn) billion for spending on health, education, housing and social inclusiveness in 2016. In Catalonia, a parliamentary majority of pro-independence parties has voted in favour of a new Catalan state and is about to pass a law creating the region's own tax office.

{"article": "Wigan made a great start as, triggered by young debutant James Worthington's early try, the hosts went 20-0 up in 20 minutes, Lewis Tierney, Liam Marshall and Tommy Leuluai all crossing too. But Bill Tupou's 11-minute hat-trick saw Trinity go 22-20 up at half-time. Danny Kirmond, Liam Finn, who kicked six goals, and Jacob Miller all added to Mason Caton-Brown's first-half try. The transformation came when Wakefield responded to the concession of Wigan's fourth try by bringing on Anthony England and David Fifita to give more power to the visitors' pack. But they could not have envisaged quite such a turnaround as, from Tupou's first touchdown in the 25th minute, followed by Caton-Brown, the big winger bagged two more to double his try tally for the season to six by the 36th minute. Finn, whose conversion of Tupou's hat-trick try gave Trinity the lead for the first time, missed just once, although allowed the luxury of a rare re-taken conversion to Miller's late try. Centre Worthington and winger Marshall, who took his tally to 16 for the season, both added a second try after the break. But George Williams landed only two of his conversion attempts, prompting a late change of kicker to Marshall, to exacerbate Wigan's woes as they suffered a fourth home defeat of the season. They remain a distant eight points off top spot, while Wakefield, up into fourth, remain six points behind leaders Castleford, who won comfortably at Leigh. Wakefield had lost on all their previous eight visits to Wigan, but it is only 13 months since they ran in 11 tries on home soil at Belle Vue to win 62-0, their record win against Wigan. Wigan boss Shaun Wane revealed that Joe Burgess and Joel Tomkins have a chance of playing at Hull on Saturday, while Liam Forsyth will be in contention after missing the game with a head knock. But the only real positive he took was the two tries for 20-year-old former Wigan St Judes junior Worthington, who scored with his first touch on his first start for his home-town club. Wigan coach Shaun Wane: \"Wigan teams should never be giving up a 20-0 lead, no matter what. But no excuses from us. We were beaten by the better team. \"We were a bit out of juice. They are a big team. We came into it a bit lethargic and you just have to try and manage their big bodies. \"We gave a few penalties away and just didn't make those one-on-one tackles. We fell apart and missed too many one-on-ones. We made some poor defensive errors and put ourselves under pressure. \"James Worthington is a Wigan kid. I only told him he was playing on Sunday and he was very nervous. To score with his first touch was fantastic. He made a couple of defensive errors but took his tries really well.\" Wakefield coach Chris Chester: \"For the first 20 minutes, we couldn't control the ball. We were completing at 50 per cent.

{"article": "Summing up a disability discrimination tribunal, Newcastle's lawyer, Sean Jones QC, said the club \"still had respect and affection\" for Gutierrez. But he said there were \"holes\" in the Argentine's case. In response, Gutierrez's lawyer, Martin Budworth, said Newcastle's witnesses had given \"knowingly untrue evidence\". A decision and announcement on the outcome of the case could take about a month. Gutierrez, 32, is suing Newcastle over the way he was treated following his cancer diagnosis in October 2013. The Deportivo La Coruna player, who was released by Newcastle in May 2015, claims the Premier League club saw him as a liability after he returned from treatment for testicular cancer. He also alleges he was not selected for some of the second half of the 2014-15 season, when Newcastle avoided relegation on the final day of the campaign, so it would not trigger an automatic one-year contract extension. \"It's plainly ludicrous to suggest that we would manage his selection to avoid a £2.5m extension cost when what was at stake was the survival of the club,\" Jones QC told the tribunal. \"The cost of relegation to the club would have been at least £30m, with an ongoing impact of around £80m if they didn't bounce back. \"It would have been a blow to Newcastle as a city, for their fans, and would have resulted in the termination of contracts for several of his colleagues and other people. \"It would have been a huge hammer blow to their finances.\" Gutierrez previously said he was not suing the club for the money, but because the way he had been treated by the club was not right. However, Jones QC added there was dispute over the timeline of Gutierrez's case. Gutierrez claims his discrimination began when he was told he should look for another club shortly after he returned from his first round of cancer treatment at the end of 2013. But Jones QC reminded the tribunal that former manager Alan Pardew had said he had let Gutierrez know he was no longer part of the first-team plans in the summer of 2013 and better players had arrived at the club. In his closing remarks, Budworth said Newcastle had failed to call a number of witnesses, including owner Mike Ashley, and doctors who treated Gutierrez because the club was \"self-serving\". He also alleged that Pardew had given \"suspicious evidence\" and that his account had been \"tailored\" to fit the club's versions of events. Budworth said: \"The respondent (Newcastle) has preferred to help itself, rather than the tribunal.\" He added it was unfortunate there was a conflict over when Gutierrez was told to find another club and there was no evidence from Pardew or the club's hierarchy. \"There's not a single piece of paper that hints of any activity in the summer of 2013, nobody was emailed,\" he said. \"Even if the slate is clean, they do not have evidence. There are no documents.\" Budworth described the club's \"management\" of Gutierrez's appearances in the closing weeks of his contract as \"cynical\" and said it was not just a \"cruel coincidence\" he was urged to look for a new club just a couple of weeks after coming back from his first diagnosis.", "question": "Newcastle have described as \" ludicrous \" claims by former midfielder Jonas Gutierrez that he was deliberately @placeholder so the club could release him .", "option_0": "dropped", "option_1": "committed", "option_2": "manipulated", "option_3": "killed", "option_4": "hired", "label": 0}

{"article": "Lebanon now has \"the highest per capita concentration of refugees worldwide\", said the head of the UN refugee agency. \"For Lebanon, a small nation beset by internal difficulties, the impact is staggering,\" he added. About 9.5 million people, almost half of Syria's population, have fled their homes since the start of the conflict. More than 2.5 million have fled the country, with large numbers being taken in by Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt and others. However Lebanon is bearing the biggest burden of all - the number of Syrian refugees there now amount to a quarter of the local population. By Jim MuirBBC News, Beirut Everybody knows that the real number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is already well past the million mark, but the fact that that many have now been officially registered is yet another grim milestone as the conflict grinds on. Lebanon's the smallest and most vulnerable of Syria's neighbours, yet it's taken in by far the largest number of refugees - one for every four of the country's own people. That's a huge strain - the foreign minister said last month that it threatened Lebanon's very existence, and it's growing all the time, with about 2,500 new refugees being registered every day. The UN has only received 14% of the funding it's asked for. That means that relief has to be cut back and carefully targeted to the most needy. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says this is a huge strain for Lebanon, the smallest and most vulnerable of Syria's neighbours. Last month the Lebanese foreign minister said the crisis was \"threatening the existence\" of his country. \"The Lebanese people have shown striking generosity, but are struggling to cope,\" Mr Guterres said. The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, notes that the influx of refugees is accelerating. \"Every day, UNHCR in Lebanon registers 2,500 new refugees: more than one person a minute,\" the agency said in a statement. International aid agencies are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the flow of refugees. UNHCR has only received 14% of the $6.5bn (Â£4bn; 4.7bn euros) funding it has asked for. The hardships many refugees are facing was dramatically highlighted last week when a mother with a sick husband and four children set fire to herself in protest at not receiving help. She was critically injured. The civil war in Syria between Sunni-led rebels and the government of Bashar al-Assad has also fuelled sectarian tensions in Lebanon, which has a large Sunni and Shia Muslim population.

He stumbled into the job when a fellow priest needed help. \"I didn't know what it was, I hadn't studied it,\" the father says. \"He told me what to do. I was totally ignorant.\" He has since become one of Rome's busiest exorcists, and the Catholic Church is struggling to find younger successors. Working three days a week from a windowless room at the back of his church near the Vatican, he often sees up to 30 people every day. \"Before doing exorcisms I urge people to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist, and I ask them to bring me their prognosis. I'm in touch with many psychologists who send their patients here.\" Vatican denies Pope performed exorcism The country where exorcisms are on the rise Arrests after woman dies in 'exorcism ritual' in Germany On one side of the room, a cabinet is filled with hundreds of small statues of angels. In a drawer, he keeps a supply of sweets to hand out to his visitors. On the wall is an official document showing his qualification as an exorcist. Fr Taraborelli's desk is crowded with papers, photos, and prayer books. He sits in a simple chair; those who come to see him sit opposite him. Before doing exorcisms I urge people to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist. I ask them to bring me their prognosis.\" \"First of all, I get the room ready,\" he says. \"Then if the person is not doing well, I try to calm them down reassure them. I invite them to join me in prayer. But many of them when they come here are already disturbed.\" He looks through his copy of the Catholic Church's exorcism rites. He's had to tape it back together to stop it from falling apart. Amidst the pile of papers on his desk, he finds the cross he uses to expel evil spirits. His most notable case involved a married woman he treated for 13 years. \"Another man, who was a Satanist, wanted her,\" he remembers. \"She refused. So this man told her: 'You'll pay for this.' He cast so-called spells to attract her to him, twice a week. \"Then they came to me, in this room. I started to pray, and she went into a trance. She would blurt out insults, blasphemies. I quickly understood she was possessed. \"As the rite continued, she started feeling worse and worse. So when I told the devil: 'In the name of Jesus, I order you to go away', she started to vomit little metal pins, five at a time. \"Aside from pins she would also vomit hair braids, little stones, pieces of wood. It sounds like something from another world right? Instead, it's something from this world.\" Within the Catholic Church, the concept of possession by demons is an accepted belief. It is sometimes used to explain murderous behaviour, as in the recent murder of 85-year-old French priest Fr Jacques Hamel in his church in the French city of Rouen in July. Survivor tells of priest's murder What we know of Church attack When two Islamist militants acting in the name of jihadist group Islamic State (IS) burst into the church and stabbed Fr Hamel, he tried to fend them off, crying out \"Be gone, Satan!\" - an apparent attempt at exorcism. In support of the priest's actions, Pope Francis accelerated the process of Fr Hamel's candidacy for sainthood. But outside the Catholic Church, many dispute the entire basis of demonic possession and exorcism. Non-believers argue that so-called possession by evil spirits is simply a medieval superstition or myth. Those who claim to be possessed by evil spirits are people suffering from easily explicable psychological or psychiatric problems, they say. Fr Taraborelli rejects the scepticism. \"Well, someone who isn't a believer doesn't believe in the devil either,\" he says, \"But someone who believes knows that the devil exists, you can read it in the gospel. Then you only need to see how the world is nowadays. It has never been this bad. These violence acts are not human. So terrible, like IS.\" Fr Taraborelli shows no sign of wanting to give up his work and his mobile phone rings constantly. But younger priests are not particularly attracted by the prospect of spending hours in windowless rooms, reading exorcism rites to disturbed believers. \"I told the bishop that I can't find anyone willing to do this. Many of them are scared. Even priests can be scared. It's a difficult life.\"", "question": "\" That is a possessed woman there , \" says Fr Vincenzo Taraborelli as he points up to an 18th Century fresco in his Roman church . \" They 're holding her with her mouth open .

Emergency work to try to avoid another breach will begin immediately and will last up to 90 days, the company said. The company initially said that two of its dams - Fundao and Germano - had burst on 5 November. But it has now clarified that only the Fundao reservoir collapsed. Germano and another nearby dam, Santarem, are still standing but are at risk, said Samarco's Infrastructure Director Kleber Terra. Samarco is owned by  by mining giants Vale, from Brazil, and Anglo-Australian company BHP Billiton. It agreed on Monday to pay the Brazilian government 1bn reais (Â£170m; $260m) compensation. The money will be used to cover the initial clean-up and to offer some compensation to the victims and their families. But the amount agreed is relatively small, prosecutors said. It will be considered \"only as a first instalment\" to be paid by the company, state prosecutor Carlos Eduardo Ferreira Pinto told O Estado de Minas newspaper. The Fundao dam breach caused rivers of mud to descend on nearby villages. Bento Rodrigues was totally destroyed. More than 500 people lost their homes there.

{"article": "Thames Water said the sewer would stop millions of tonnes of sewage leaking into the River Thames every year. But the Thames Tunnel Commission favours a shorter tunnel with \"greener\" options for preventing rain water entering the sewage system Thames Water said it would study the findings of the commission which was sponsored by five London councils. The inquiry was commissioned amid concerns that water bills would have to rise to finance the project and fears over the loss of green space and regeneration sites. The Thames Tunnel Commission (TTC) examined whether the 20-mile (32km) tunnel from west to east London was the best solution to the problem of raw sewage entering the Thames. Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Lord Selborne, who led the team that scrutinised the plans, said: \"Our forensic analysis shows there is a substantial body of evidence pointing to the fact that there is a smarter way to make the River Thames cleaner. \"A shorter tunnel, combined with green infrastructure solutions that are built up incrementally in the medium to long term, would be both compliant with EU directives and less costly and disruptive to Londoners. \"These alternatives require further study.\" The report recommended the primary reason for rejecting a short tunnel that costs less than half the current \"super sewer\" estimate \"should be revisited as a matter of urgency\". It also found complimentary environmentally friendly solutions that minimise the amount of fresh rain water entering the sewerage system should be considered. A Thames Water spokesman said: \"To be a viable proposition, any alternative to the Thames Tunnel would need to provide a more economical way of meeting the environmental objectives set by the Environment Agency for the health of the river, within the time scale required by the government.\" He said it would be a \"valuable contribution\" to a second consultation into the scheme which starts on Friday. At the same time as the report was being published, Thames Tunnel Now, a coalition of 15 environmental charities, including the Angling Trust, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, WWF-UK, and the London Wildlife Trust, said it backed the sewer plan.

{"article": "Unrest broke out on Sunday over the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer in Ferguson. People looted shops, vandalised cars and stores, and set a building alight as police tried to block off access to several areas of the city. Police say Michael Brown, 18, was shot on Saturday afternoon in the mainly black suburb of St Louis. He was shot several times after a struggle in a police car, they said. On Monday, dozens of residents marched through the streets demanding justice. As residents began the task of cleaning up, some said they believed the violence was not over. DeAndre Smith, 30, of Ferguson told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that the rioting reflected a sense of injustice in the community. \"I don't think it's over honestly,\" he said. \"I just think they got a taste of what fighting back means.\" St Louis County police say the FBI has now taken over the investigation into Mr Brown's death. The rioting erupted late on Sunday after thousands of people attended a candlelight vigil for the slain man. County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after the officer encountered two men, including Mr Brown, on a street in Ferguson. Mr Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. At least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car, Mr Belmar said. But authorities say they are still trying to clarify exactly what happened inside the vehicle. The officer involved has been with the Ferguson police department for six years, and has been placed on paid administrative leave, Mr Belmar said. Mayor James Knowles said he understood that people \"want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out\", but he added: \"We're going to obviously try to urge calm.\" Mr Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said her son had graduated from high school and planned to go to a local college. The killing has drawn comparisons by some civil rights leaders with the 2012 killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighbourhood watch organiser who was acquitted of murder charges. \"We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,\" said John Gaskin, of the civil rights group NAACP.", "question": "Police in the US state of Missouri say they have arrested 32 people as calm @placeholder after a night of rioting .", "option_0": "injured", "option_1": "clashes", "option_2": "returned", "option_3": "drowned", "option_4": "continues", "label": 2}
{"article": "He became famous for his sweaters and the rocking chair in which he invariably sat to sing the final number of his show. At a time when the 60s pop explosion was stalling the careers of so many crooners, Doonican bucked the trend with eight Top-20 hits. And songs like Delaney's Donkey and Paddy McGinty's Goat allowed record-buyers to indulge themselves in a touch of Irish-flavoured whimsy. Michael Valentine Doonican was born in the Irish city of Waterford on 3 February 1927, the youngest of eight children. His father died of cancer when he was 14 and he was forced to leave school and work in a packaging factory to supplement the family income. He wrote music from a very young age, and formed a singing group with his friends when he was just 10. With his guitar, he later took part in the town's first ever television broadcast and, after his first paid engagement at the Waterford fete, left his factory job to tour the country in a caravan. In 1951, Doonican was invited to join a group called the Four Ramblers. The band toured England where Doonican was introduced to the joys of golf, and also to his future wife, the cabaret star Lynnette Rae. Doonican later moved to London, where he continued his entertainment apprenticeship in radio, television, cabaret and music hall. He recalled that \"it took 17 years to become an overnight success\", when his appearance on Sunday Night at the Palladium prompted the BBC to offer him his own series in 1964. He was given an initial series of six half-hour programmes which were broadcast live from a BBC studio in an old chapel in Manchester. The Val Doonican Music show saw him become a mainstay of Saturday night television. But he was always grateful that his career gave him the opportunity to meet his idols such as Bing Crosby and Howard Keel. \"You can't imagine,\" he later recalled, \"that you're going along in your young life, buying records of people that you think are fantastic and, in my case, I ended up singing duets with them on my show.\" The comedian Dave Allen also got his big break by appearing on the show. In the 1970s, his fame spread when the programme was transmitted overseas. Two of Doonican's most enduring props were his collection of multi-coloured sweaters - which became known as \"Val Doonican jumpers\" - and his ever-present rocking chair. In fact, the star swapped his sweaters for jackets back in 1970, so remained bemused when people everywhere continued to ask him where his jumper was. Doonican went on to record more than 50 albums, and he appeared several times on Top of the Pops. At a time when the charts were dominated by pop groups he had a string of hits including Special Years, Walk Tall and What Would I Be? The television shows came to an end after 24 years, but Doonican continued to tour, choosing mostly intimate regional theatres, in the UK and abroad. He eschewed television appearances, preferring to share his time between Buckinghamshire and Spain, and to spend his semi-retirement playing golf. \"Golf is like an 18-year-old girl with big boobs,\" he once said. \"You know it's wrong but you can't keep away from her.\" His other great hobby was painting, and his work was exhibited around the country. A lot of his art was inspired by his Irish homeland, where he remained revered for his modest charm and embrace of original Gaelic values. In 2001, Doonican and his wife returned to Waterford to receive the gift of a rocking chair.

Urban development is encroaching on bat habitats and residents worried about disease, noise and odours have sought to move bat colonies away from their houses.

Rosberg hoped governing body the FIA had stuck to the safety guidelines that govern tracks, but added: \"I'm doubting it a little because of those corners.\" The main areas of concern on the new track, which joins both the new and historic old parts of the city and is expected to be the fastest street circuit in F1 history, are turns three, seven and 15 and the pit-lane entry. Button said: \"We trust in the FIA and they do a fantastic job in keeping us safe. They have improved pretty much every circuit we go to, including Monaco. \"It's just that on certain corners here, it looks as if there is not a lot of run-off. Hopefully I'm wrong.\" He added: \"It is fine as long as no-one has a failure, we will go away all happy. We just have to hope that doesn't happen.\" Button said the most critical area was turn 15, which the drivers will approach at estimated speeds of about 180mph after a long flat-out section. He said: \"There is run-off but you have to turn right to take it.\" Rosberg added: \"The track is great, the place is great. I have been welcomed very well so I'm sure all in all it will be a great success. \"But there is a bit of a concern for sure with those run-offs. That's not great. The corner before going down the hill (15) where you have a wall straight on, turn three, and then the pit entry as well. that is not fantastic.\" The pit-lane entry is towards the end of a 2.1-kilometre straight, where cars are expected to be travelling in excess of 200mph, and features a tight chicane. The area governed by the pit-lane speed limit does not start until after the chicane. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo said the pit entry \"is going to be quite cool\" because, as it is effectively part of the race track, there was \"between half-a-second and a second\" for a driver to gain in the chicane.

{"article": "Pepsi apologised and pulled the ad after accusations that it trivialised recent street protests across the US. But it wasn't the only company copping flak for poor creativity this week. German skincare brand Nivea also said sorry over its \"white is purity\" deodorant advert that was deemed discriminatory and racially insensitive. Meanwhile, in the UK, the Co-op supermarket was accused of \"outrageous sexism\" in an advert for chocolate Easter eggs that encouraged parents to \"treat your daughter for doing the washing up\", while Cadbury was criticised after dropping the word \"Easter\" from its egg hunts. These campaigns have now taken their place in the pantheon of bad advertising. Here are a few more picks from recent memory. Here's another one that left a sour taste. The Snickers TV advert featuring Mr T as BA Baracus from The A-Team was pulled after it was accused of being insulting to gay men. Mr T is shown firing Snickers chocolate bars at a man who's speed walking in tight yellow shorts, while yelling, \"You are a disgrace to the man race. It's time to run like a real man.\" Confectionery giant Mars, which owns Snickers, released a statement saying the advert was intended to be funny but that \"humour is highly subjective\". In the US and most of the West, this poster would have caused outrage and accusations of racism. But in Thailand, an image of a woman in blackface and bright pink lipstick to promote a new \"charcoal donut\" wasn't deemed a big deal. The chief executive of the Thai franchise - whose daughter was the model - reportedly said at the time: \"I don't get it. What's the big fuss? What if the product was white and I painted someone white, would that be racist?\" But a spokesman for Dunkin' Brands apologised. The use of blackface - which historically was used by non-black performers to represent a black person - is still used in some Asian countries. Last year, a company in China used it to promote a laundry detergent. The US carmaker was forced to issue an apology over a poster that featured three gagged and bound women in the boot of a car. It also showed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in the driver's seat grinning and flashing the peace sign. The advert for Ford's new Fido hatchback was posted online soon after India passed a new law on violence against women following a fatal gang rape. This anti-gambling advert deserves to be ranked in the Hall of Fame (or shame) for the amount of jokes it generated. It was released to coincide with the 2014 World Cup and featured a boy complaining to friends that his dad had bet his life savings on Germany winning. The trouble is... Germany won. Singapore officials updated the ad but not before it got lampooned around the world. It takes quite a lot to shock in France, a country many consider to be one of the most liberal in Europe. But a 2010 anti-smoking advertisement featuring teenagers and oral sex innuendos did just that, with one minister calling it an \"outrage to decency\". Critics said the highly suggestive pictures trivialised the sexual abuse of minors. Thankfully we've since moved on to pictures of diseased organs to put people off smoking instead. There wasn't any cheering when the US department store Bloomingdale's released its Christmas catalogue two years ago. The photo of an attractive, well-dressed woman being eyeballed by an unsmiling man looked innocent enough... Until you read the creepy caption that said \"spike your best friend's eggnog when they're not looking\". The online backlash was swift with many interpreting it as supporting date rape. Bloomingdale's admitted the ad was \"in poor taste\". Benetton's \"Unhate\" campaign (which still exists) had good intentions when it launched in 2011. But on one of its images the Italian clothing company clearly took its photo-editing skills too far. It received a warning and the threat of legal action from the Vatican for a \"totally unacceptable\" image of Pope Benedict XVI kissing an Egyptian imam, and subsequently withdrew the ad. The Vatican said in a statement that the ad was \"damaging not only to the dignity of the Pope and the Catholic Church but also to the feelings of believers\". The White House also disapproved of the images featuring then-President Barack Obama but Benetton kept those. We live in a time where race and gender and sexual orientation remain highly sensitive topics. So what can brands do to generate buzz without offending? David Meikle, who founded marketing consultancy Salt, doubts that Pepsi will suffer from any long-term damage from the Kendall Jenner ad fiasco. \"Pepsi seems to have managed the retraction and apology quite well.

{"article": "Mr Kerry said there would be \"repercussions\" if the Syrian government flouted a cessation of violence agreed in February. A resurgence in fighting, particularly in the northern city of Aleppo, has threatened to derail the partial truce. More than 250 people have been killed in Aleppo in the past 10 days. As diplomatic efforts intensified on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a unilateral truce declared by the Syrian military could be extended to Aleppo \"in the next few hours\". After talks with UN envoy Staffan de Mistura in Moscow, he said Russia was working with the UN and US to include Aleppo in the \"regime of calm\" that has covered Damascus and Latakia since Saturday. On Tuesday, 19 people were killed by rebel rocket fire in government-controlled areas of Aleppo, monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. State media said a hospital was hit, killing three people and wounding 17. Last Wednesday, an air strike on a hospital in a rebel-held area killed 55 people. The US blamed the attack on government forces. Speaking in Washington, Mr Kerry said he was hopeful the cessation of violence could be restored, and he warned President Assad of consequences if violations continued. \"If Assad does not adhere to this, there will clearly be repercussions, and one of them may be the total destruction of the ceasefire and then go back to war. I don't think Russia wants that,\" he said. Mr Kerry added: \"If Assad's strategy is to somehow think he's going to just carve out Aleppo and carve out a section of the country, I've got news for him - this war doesn't end. \"It is simply physically impossible for Assad to just carve out an area and pretend that he's somehow going to make it safe, while the underlying issues are unresolved in this war. And as long as Assad is there, the opposition is not going to stop fighting it... one way or the other.\" He reiterated there was an August deadline for starting a political transition in Syria. Earlier this year, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned that Russia might be trying to create a mini-state for President Assad in the north-west of the country, which includes Aleppo. Russia strongly denied the idea. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Lavrov told reporters that he expected a decision on including Aleppo in the separate regime of calm \"in the very near future - maybe in the next few hours\". The unilateral truce had been effect in Latakia and the eastern Ghouta region around Damascus since the weekend thanks to the efforts of the Russian and US militaries, he said. The aim of Russian, US and UN negotiators was to extend the regime of calm and \"ideally make it indefinite\", Mr Lavrov added. But he warned that so-called moderate rebel groups in Aleppo had to leave areas where militants from al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate that is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, were being targeted. The partial halt in fighting has raised hopes that tentative peace talks in Geneva might bring forward a solution to Syria's bloody five-year civil war. But the truce all but collapsed after renewed violence, particularly in Aleppo. Also on Tuesday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding the protection of hospitals, clinics and health workers in war zones. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said there was no justification for attacks on medical facilities.

{"article": "UCAS announced earlier this year that there had been a notable decrease in students from England applying to do at least one nursing course, saying it had fallen 23% to 33,810 in 2017. Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke last week about the \"very high numbers of foreign workers keeping our NHS going\". Looking at the figures from NHS Digital, overall, 82% of NHS staff are UK nationals, with 5% from the European Economic Area (EEA, that's the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and 6% from the rest of the world. The remaining 7% are of unknown nationalities. The unknowns are relatively high because they come from electronic staff records, not HR information, and it is not compulsory for staff to declare their nationalities for those records. For doctors, it's 70% UK, 9% EEA, 16% from the rest of the world and 5% unknown. And for nurses and health visitors it is 78% UK, 7% EEA, 8% from the rest of the world and 6% unknown. To put that into context, according to the latest labour market figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 7.3% of workers in the UK are EU nationals while 3.9% are from the rest of the world. Clearly, the unknowns throw comparisons out a bit, but the proportion of NHS staff from the EEA appears to be a bit below the workforce as a whole while there are considerably more from the rest of the world than the workforce average. For doctors, there are proportionally more foreign nationals than in the workforce as a whole, especially for those from the rest of the world. If you look at the figures for where doctors earned their qualifications, the rest of the world comes even higher with 27%, compared with 64% from the UK and 9% from the EEA. Nurses from the EEA work in the NHS in the same proportion as the rest of the workforce while nurses from the rest of the world are overrepresented.

{"article": "The briefings highlight an almost impossible dilemma, one still faced today by every director of National Intelligence: what should, and should not, be included? Former US director of National Intelligence John Negroponte delivered the PDB to President George W Bush. He spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about what the president needs to know: \"The President's Daily Brief represents the best effort of the intelligence community to present the best possible analysis of current events that are of policy interest to the White House and the United States government. A typical brief will have six or seven articles, usually not exceeding one page, sometimes just a paragraph. And then one or two longer 'deep dive' pieces. There's a presidential daily briefing staff that works around the clock. The bulk of articles are prepared by CIA analysts. The analysts draft some briefs the previous evening, then spend until about two or three in the morning polishing the articles, and then complete the PDB sometime around four or five o'clock in the morning. I had a small classified fax machine in the basement of my house with a guard standing over it, and I would usually read the first draft before bed. I would wake about five, listen to the radio, read the newspapers and then go into the office. I would meet the analyst who was going to brief the president at 6:30, and we'd go over the product. Very rarely we might decide to omit a particular article, not because we're holding something back, but because we felt the product could improve, might not be ready for prime time. And then a few minutes before 8:00 we would go to the outer office of the president until he was ready. He took that briefing every day of the week, Monday through Friday, and Saturdays as well. He was very disciplined about it, and he was what the intelligence community would call 'an excellent customer'. He was interested and anything but passive. He'd interrupt and say 'I don't really believe that, let's talk about this' or 'would you please look into this part more?' or 'could you also answer this question?' He had a dialectic style where he liked to come to a better understanding of what was being presented to him through discussion and debate. \"These meetings usually went for 30 minutes, unless he got terribly interested in something and we might spill over. With him he had the vice president, the National Security Advisor, and his chief of staff. Our mission was to present him with the best possible assessments of the various situations of concern, whether it was the situation in Iraq, or the leadership competition in Iran: difficult subjects that were very germane to the policies that he was either carrying out or developing, based on clandestinely obtained information that might not be otherwise be available. How do you decide what goes in? What do you decide to put in the BBC headlines? How does the editor of the New York Times decide what stories to give priority to? It's a sifting process, and if you're the president, you have to let people below you prioritise what they think is important. And equally important is what then do you choose to really analyse?  Because it's one thing to have the headline, but then to make sense out of what's going on you've got to go beyond that and try to understand the underlying factors and the root causes. I would present the annual intelligence assessment in its unclassified version to the Congress, and some congressman would pipe up and say 'I could have read this in the New York Times.' But that's our best assessment of what is really happening. You might have been able to read it in a newspaper but it carries the weight, the imprimatur of the intelligence community, and a lot of sophisticated and intense analytic work. Every week the Director of National Intelligence would bring together the major agencies - the CIA, the Defence Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the FBI - to go over issues of common concern, talk about different analytic and collection issues. But rarely is intelligence a panacea. It is information based on the best possible sources that helps you narrow the range of uncertainty, that improves the confidence with which leaders can make decisions. Sometimes you get one of those silver bullets, like we got the phone number of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi [the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq], and if you have that then, of course, you can work with the National Security Agency, or GCHQ, to track his movements, I remember when we intercepted an absolutely fascinating letter that Ayman al-Zawahiri (now head of al-Qaeda, then Bin Laden's number two) had sent to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. We actually intercepted it before Zarqawi read it. It was a long discourse on Zarqawi's tactics, asking him to tone them down. Rather amusingly at the end Zawahiri said 'By the way, could you please send us â‚¬100,000?'. So the branch office, al-Qaeda in Iraq, was richer than headquarters, and headquarters was asking him for money. Afterwards we had quite a debate in the White House about whether we should release that letter publicly. The president favoured releasing it. I was a little bit reluctant but we eventually did, and it makes for very good reading. But intelligence failures are real. Hindsight is 20/20 vision and you can always connect the dots after the fact. You look back and you can identify the bits of information that you missed, and that you failed to connect to some event that subsequently occurred. But let's be honest, there's a lot of noise. Like Pearl Harbor; we knew something was going to happen, we didn't know exactly where and what. You have to sort the signals from the noise, you have to find which are the signals that really matter. And that's a matter of skill on the one hand; it's a matter of luck on the other. The key point about 9/11 was surprise. The same thing with the Cuban missile crisis, when we discovered the Soviets were going to send intercontinental missiles to Cuba. Believe it or not, two months before, the intelligence community had published an analysis saying the Soviets would never even dream of sending intercontinental ballistic missiles to Cuba. I looked at the PDBs that were released from the end of the Johnson Administration, and here's the problem I see. The redaction and vetting process is so rigid, and so careful, that if these articles had any real meat to them they get excised from the unclassified versions. There was one article, it was article number three on a particular day, and the subject was 'Canada', and then the rest was just a blank page. What are you going to do with that? Unless some guy like Mr Snowden gets hold of them and leaks them, in terms of deliberate declassification, I think that the intelligence community, especially the CIA, is going to always err on the side of caution when it comes to declassification. So you're not going to learn a lot from them.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT/13:05 BST.

{"article": "Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says the party does not want to return to an era of widespread state ownership. Instead, Labour would look to expand co-operatives and explore giving workers the \"right to own\". David Cameron has accused Labour of wanting to turn back the clock to the days of state ownership and strikes. But Mr McDonnell tackled this claim head-on in a speech in Manchester, saying Labour had to move on from its traditional belief that state ownership was always the answer. \"Whatever the achievements of the past, we cannot simply turn the clock back - whether to 1997, 1964, or 1945,\" he said. At the last election, \"the Tories talked relentlessly, overwhelmingly about the future. Labour, strikingly, did not\". \"We cannot allow that to happen again. We cannot be small 'c' conservatives.\" He added: \"A future Labour government will end the current programme of spending cuts. We will protect what has already been won. \"But we must look beyond this point. We should be seizing the opportunity to create a fairer, more democratic society.\" Labour has already announced its intention to return the railways to public ownership. But when it comes to the wider economy, Mr McDonnell said Labour should \"look elsewhere\" for solutions, and draw on its tradition of supporting workers' co-operatives. He signalled support for giving employees in companies which are about to be sold off  - or floated on the stock exchange - the first option to purchase the company. \"The Tories have offered a Right to Buy, Labour would seek to better this. We'd be creating a new Right to Own,\" he said in a speech in Manchester. He said the \"biggest hurdle\" facing co-ops and other small businesses was getting initial funding from high street banks. \"No other major developed economy has just five banks providing 80% of loans. We'd look to break up these monopolies, introducing real competition and choice. \"Regional and local banks, prudently run and with a public service mandate, have to be part of the solution here.\" Mr McDonnell is also considering adopting the Italian government's policy of offering funding to help employee-owned enterprises to get off the ground. \"With consortium co-operatives providing an effective means for new businesses to share and reduce costs, we'd look to support these at a local level, working with local authorities, businesses and trade unions,\" he said. He said the policy would be developed \"over the next few years\", adding:  \"In an uncertain world where a laissez faire market approach continues to fail, co-operation is an idea whose time has come again. \"This is the start of developing a new, positive economic alternative for Labour.\" He also urged Labour to embrace opportunities offered by the internet and new technology. \"Technology is proving disruptive. It can have terrible downsides - de-skilling and an accelerated concentration of wealth. \"But it also opens up new possibilities - the explosion of sharing that the Internet can provide. \"There is an entrepreneurial spirit at work here: not the theatrical meanness and one-upmanship of Gordon Gekko, but a desire to create something better for us all.\" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Greg Hands said Labour represented \"a threat to our economic security\".

{"article": "Too often firms just react to what software flags on their network instead of actively hunting out intruders, says the security firm Mandiant. It says hackers get control of about 40 machines in the average breach. But, it adds, often only a handful of servers are typically cleaned up. The result, it says, is that attackers can linger on internal networks for months, giving them the opportunity to steal more information. \"Most companies have a very old-fashioned way of investigating a breach,\" said Bill Hau, an executive at Mandiant. He delivered his warning on the first day of Infosecurity Europe, an industry exhibition and conference in London. It is a booming time for the sector. Spending on cybersecurity totalled $77bn (Â£53bn) last year, and is forecast to grow to $170bn by 2020. Mandiant and other incident response firms often get called in when techniques based around traditional security tools have failed to find and remove all the loopholes through which hackers have slipped. \"That old-style technology makes them think they have remediated a breach but they might never have kicked the bad guys out in the first place,\" Mr Hau told the BBC. Often, he said, attackers can \"dwell\" in networks for months during which time they seek to get high level administration access so they can erase evidence of their presence and thwart investigations. \"Companies do not understand that they have to move to a different methodology to get these guys out,\" he said. \"They need to go and look for trouble and they will find it,\" he said. \"They have to hunt them out in their own networks.\" Patrick Grillo, a senior director at security firm Fortinet, agreed that many firms spent too much time securing the edges of their networks at the expense of looking more closely at what happens internally. \"The traditional network has been built with a very strong perimeter,\" he said. \"but if the malware gets beyond that its wide open. The network is soft and chewy on the inside. \"What the bad guys want to do is get in undetected and then be able to move laterally through the network until they reach their goal.\" Most intruders seek out saleable data such as credit card numbers or personal information about customers, he said. He urged firms to run their own drills and exercises to help their own security experts familiarise themselves with a company's network and to root out any intruders.", "question": "Many companies have the wrong strategy in place to tackle data breaches , according to research released to coincide with Europe 's largest cybersecurity @placeholder .", "option_0": "pledge", "option_1": "deployment", "option_2": "event", "option_3": "epidemic", "option_4": "data", "label": 2}

The review will decide if refugees are able to stay in the UK or will return to their home country. The Home Office said it could not comment because of \"purdah\" rules. These limit government activity during the pre-election period. The department issued updated guidance on the process by which refugees already living in the UK apply to stay here permanently. Under the policy, all those who apply for settlement will be subject to a so-called \"safe return review\" to check the current situation in their home country. Campaigners claim the measures would \"put an end to hope of stability\" and end any possibility of refugees being able to integrate into society. Organisations that have signed the letter include Black Lives Matter UK, the Northern Ireland Community of Refugees and Asylum Seekers, the Scottish Refugee Council, Migrant Voice, Space4U Cardiff, Manchester Migrant Solidarity and Calais Action. Makhosi Sigabade, a refugee from Zimbabwe living in Belfast, was awarded refugee status in December.

Home Office guidance states that \"all those who apply for settlement protection after completing the appropriate probationary period of limited leave will be subject to a safe return review with reference to the country situation at the date the application is considered\". \"Those who still need protection at that point will normally qualify for settlement,\" it adds.

{"article": "The pop legend lost his cool during his performance at Gloucester's Kingsholm Stadium on Sunday. The steward incurred John's wrath for trying to stop people with cheaper tickets blocking the view of concert-goers at the front who had paid more. But sorry turned out not to be the hardest word, with John later getting her on stage and apologising. Stewards at the stadium, which is the home of Gloucester Rugby, were faced with the problem of some people moving to the front and blocking the view of others at the gig, which was supposed to be seated. The lack of crowd control has been criticised by fans, but promoter Marshall Arts, which was responsible for the stewarding, refused to comment about it. During the concert, the legendary singer-songwriter told the stewards to \"lighten up\". He told them: \"These people have come here to hear music so if they want to put their hands in the air, let them.\" In an expletive-laden rant, John went to say it was \"not China\" and he picked out a female steward, telling her: \"You put a uniform on and you think you're Hitler - well you're not.\" Moments later the woman could be seen on the big screen walking away from the stage area, while people cheered the Rocket Man writer's outburst. Steven Ward, from Tewkesbury, who attended the event, said: \"This [concert] was seated, there were disabled people who were sat on our aisle who couldn't see, obviously they couldn't stand up to see the stage. \"There were people fighting to get a view of what they were trying to look at and, for some reason, the stewards brought out barriers to try and stop people, but that made them worse because they congregated by the barrier.\" Gloucester Rugby's commercial manager, Mike Turner, said: \"The Elton John concert is a stadium hire so Elton brings on his own stewards. \"Our stewards man the corporate areas and everything else is manned by the production company Elton uses. \"The stewards did their best to bring the concert back to how it should be.\" A spokesman for Marshall Arts said the concert had been a great success but she would not comment on any aspect of the stewarding, which she said was subcontracted to another company.", "question": "Sir Elton John @placeholder a steward to Hitler as she tried to stop crowds from surging forward during a gig .", "option_0": "delivered", "option_1": "is", "option_2": "likened", "option_3": "launched", "option_4": "played", "label": 2}

{"article": "Two of them did not march to police lines at the junction of Woodvale Road and Woodvale Parade on 12 July, the point at which the Parades Commission said the parade must stop. In the previous three years, the Orange Order arrived in force, with hundreds of members, supporters and bandsmen. But, on Tuesday, fewer than 20 members of Ballysillan lodge, and a small number of supporters, arrived at a police barrier erected across the road. They clearly expected the other lodges to join them, and waited for an hour and a quarter for them to do so. The assembled media were told repeatedly by Orange, loyalist and police sources that Ligoniel True Blues and the Earl of Erne lodges were on their way. But they never came. At 20:30 BST, looking visibly frustrated, members of Ballysillan LOL 1891 walked away from police lines and dispersed. The lodge and the Orange Order have since rejected any suggestion it was deliberately left out on a limb for opposing a deal with a nationalist residents' group in Ardoyne to end the parade dispute. The proposed deal collapsed earlier this month after Ballysillan made it clear it would not back it, while the others said they would. Gerald Solinas, a spokesman for Ballysillan, said it was simply because the other lodges would not have made it to the police barrier before the 20:30 BST cut-off point imposed by the parades commission. The Orange Order has backed this claim and insisted what happened was not the result of a deliberate decision to isolate Ballysillan. But the BBC has established that a deliberate decision was taken to keep the three lodges apart. There are more than 100 lodges within Belfast County Grand Lodge Each of them is a member of one of nine districts. Traditionally all lodges within each district walk together. However, that has not happened in north Belfast since this disputed parade was prevented from completing its return leg past the Ardoyne shop fronts in July 2013. Since then, the three lodges involved in the dispute have marched together in solidarity, despite being members of different districts. Ballysillan LOL 1891 is member of District Number Three, Ligoniel True Blues LOL 1932 part of Number One, and the Earl of Erne LOL 647 is a member of District Number Four. In the three previous years the lodges were given special allowances by their governing body, Belfast County Grand Lodge, to walk together close to the head of the Twelfth parade. That changed this year. Instead, the lodges decided they would parade as part of their own districts, and not together. Each year one of the districts leads the parade. This year it was the turn of District Number Three, so Ballysillan helped lead the way. The other districts then followed in numerical order, with the Earl of Erne, District Number Four, directly behind them. Districts five, six, seven, eight and nine then followed, before going back to District Number One, which meant Ligoneil was towards the back of the parade. The Orange Order claim that the Earl of Erne and Ligoneil decided to disperse early because they ran out of time and could not make the police barriers before the 20:30 BST deadline imposed by the Parades Commission. That might stand up to scrutiny if both of the other lodges were together at the back of the parade. But they weren't. So how could it be that Ballysillan, which is part of District Number Three, reached the barrier on the Woodvale Road at 19:15 BST, while a lodge in the district immediately behind them could not make it an hour and a quarter later? An Orange Order source says members of the Earl of Erne lodge decided to wait for Ligoniel True Blues before walking to the police lines. That means they took a conscious decision not to join Ballysillan. Whatever the Order might say, that decision, and the decision by Belfast County Grand Lodge not to have three north Belfast lodges march together this year, resulted in Ballysillan appearing to be isolated, with little support.", "question": "Tuesday marked the first time since a stand - off over a disputed Orange Order parade in Belfast started in July 2013 , that the three lodges involved have not spoken with one @placeholder .", "option_0": "voice", "option_1": "more", "option_2": "parent", "option_3": "level", "option_4": "events", "label": 0}
{"article": "Now, following the leak of the Mossack Fonseca files, the arc lights of publicity are being shone harshly on those, including Britain's prime minister, who appear to have benefited from funds being invested in offshore, low-tax jurisdictions. It may be legal, but the court of public opinion is indignant and moralistic in its judgement. Those Panamanian files are not the start. Corporate tax avoidance - or \"planning\" - has also been put under a much brighter spotlight in recent years. Some of the giants that dominate the digital marketplace have felt the heat from public opinion, including their customers, who don't like what they're learning. It's put some people right off their Starbucks coffee. While tax revenue is scarce, and public services squeezed, the British public understandably want to see the corporate elite, as well as the wealthy, picking up more of the cost of supporting the society from which they benefit. But there's another way of looking at it. Viewed from much of the developing world, Britain is a tax haven. In addition, it does very nicely out of providing financial advice and services to minimise tax bills around the world. Hundreds of billions of pounds-worth of tax revenue that could be going into the public services of developing nations moves into Britain, Ireland, Luxembourg and other relatively low-tax jurisdictions. This has become one of the main campaigning planks for poverty campaign groups such as Christian Aid and Oxfam. It is also enthusiastically pursued by the \"rich country club\" of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). They cite figures from the United Nations conference on trade and development (UNCTAD), published last year. It estimates multi-national corporations pay around $220bn in tax on corporate profits, but use offshore tax loopholes to avoid paying another $100bn. So it's nearly a third gets disappeared. That's in addition to the plunder of assets by individuals, who send their money out of country. The UK is seen as a significant part of that problem. Some economists reckon that a shakedown of the system would not only hit the British Virgin Islands, but Britain itself, as a net loser if there were a transition to a genuinely fair taxation regime around the world. For developing countries, the tax base tends to be weak, in that few individuals have significant income and wealth. Business taxation is therefore more important to them. The UNCTAD study showed that the average developed country relies on corporate taxation for 5% of tax. For developing countries, even without the tax lost to multi-nationals placing their taxable income offshore, the share is double that. In Africa, it is 14%. So when corporate tax is lost, through multi-national companies transferring profit to lower-tax countries, that loads more weight on to the remaining tax payers. It is unfair on smaller companies that do not trade across borders (also true of smaller companies in Britain). And there is a risk that it erodes confidence in the system. The respect for law and HMRC authority in Britain is not shared everywhere. Where taxes are dodged by some, and enforcement is weak, payment of tax quickly comes to be seen as optional. Anti-poverty groups are working together in campaigns to change corporate behaviour on tax - to encourage companies to see tax payment as a responsibility, but also in their own interests. They argue that the good corporate citizen, as with the good individual one, sees tax payment as the price for supporting a stable, law-abiding, prosperous society from which all that income and wealth is derived. It might even be seen as an investment in society. Since the financial crash brought the wheels off last decade's money-making juggernaut, there has been more questioning of whether the legal construct of a company is suited to society's needs. Its mission, defined by statute, legal judgement and convention, is to maximise shareholder value, which can have a destructive effect on societies, workers, justice, human rights and the environment. So there is growing interest in re-defining companies, and directing them to a more nuanced set of priorities.  Using legislation passed in most of the states of the USA over the past six years, the \"Benefit Corporation\" or B-Corp, is one which legally registers as having more on its mind than maximising shareholder value. It has to demonstrate how well it's achieving those other objectives. Italy and Australia are following. Worldwide, 1,600 companies have been certified as B-Corps. Since autumn, a British campaign office has been seeking recruits, with 79 already signed up, ranging across 12 sectors. It may not add much to what's already in place. You might argue that the social enterprise movement in Britain is already well down that road, or that the Community Interest Company, an entity created by a 2005 Westminster law, is ahead of America's B-Corp. It is probably easier to define a company's social or environmental mission from start-up. But converting an existing, conventional company to a Benefit Corporation is a tough sell to boardrooms and to investors. Institutional funds are mostly required to maximise shareholder value as well. And the B-Corp's credit rating is more complex to calculate. This is a big challenge to a factor that runs deep and across societies - the desire first to be financially secure, and then to maximise wealth. The latter is sometimes also known as greed.", "question": "The Panama Papers are offering up much evidence of what was long @placeholder .

Many people are yet to receive the aid, which is piling up at Kathmandu airport, a week after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on 25 April. More than 7,000 have died. Authorities have ruled out finding more survivors. On Saturday, Baroness Amos said she had reminded Prime Minister Sushil Koirala that Nepal had signed an agreement with the UN in 2007 for simpler and faster customs clearance for relief aid in a disaster. \"He has undertaken to ensure that happens, so I hope that from now we will see an improvement in those administrative issues,\" she told AFP news agency. The UN representative in the country, Jamie McGoldrick, said the Nepalese government \"should not be using peacetime customs methodology\". Nepal lifted import taxes on tarpaulins and tents on Friday but home ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal said all goods arriving from abroad had to be inspected. \"This is something we need to do,\" he said. Rameshwor Dangal, of Nepal's National Disaster Management Division, said many people were waiting to receive emergency supplies or be airlifted to safety. \"In many areas people are not getting relief and it is natural that they are unhappy about it,\" he told AFP.

Landslides and poor weather have hampered efforts to deliver aid to isolated districts, and there are only about 20 helicopters available for the rescue and relief operations.

{"article": "As the film \"Suffragette,\" opens in British cinemas there is renewed attention on that struggle, one in which Scotland played a vital part. \"For a long time the suffrage movement, as far as history is concerned was located in London and the national leadership was located there too,\" says Dr Norman Watson, a journalist and historian who has researched the suffragettes for 30 years. But he points to the fact that Edinburgh had one of the earliest suffrage societies in the 1870s and by the period after 1905 Scotland was \"punching above its weight\" in the struggle for votes. There were plenty of opportunities to confront the establishment with then prime minister Herbert Asquith having his constituency in Fife and Winston Churchill as an MP for Dundee. He continues: \"So with the militant women pledging to argue at every by-election at which the Liberal party stood because the Liberal party kept refusing them votes, this really catapulted the militancy episode into Scotland and all parts of Scotland were involved.\" When Churchill came to stand in Dundee in 1908 he was followed by 27 of the national leaders of women's suffrage movements. At one point he even hid in a shed and tried to hold a meeting there. There had been lots of campaigning for the vote towards the end of the 19th Century mainly using methods such at petitions, writing letters and badgering members of parliament. That changed in 1903 with the establishment by the Pankhursts, and others, of the Women's Social and Political Union. A branch was opened in Glasgow in 1906 and by 1908 its Scottish headquarters had been opened in the city. \"At first the suffragettes tend to go down to England in order to commit some of the more militant acts,\" says Prof Sarah Pedersen of Robert Gordon University who is writing a book on the Scottish suffragettes. \"We don't really get much militant suffrage activity going on Scotland until a couple of years before the First World War but once they get started they do quite a lot of damage.\" She points to the burning down of buildings, the grandstands at Ayr and Perth racecourses, the pouring of acid in post boxes to destroy the mail or burning the slogan 'votes for women' into the greens of golf courses with acid. \"One of the things to note is that they were very careful not to actually harm or kill anyone with all these fires, the places they set fire to were empty. What they were hoping for was that the landowners and the insurance companies would put pressure on the government to give women the vote,\" she continues. A important point for the movement in Scotland was a big rally in Edinburgh in 1909. It was led by the formidable Flora Drummond, riding on horseback. A key figure in the movement, she had grown up in Arran. Edinburgh had a rather less positive claim to fame too though. It was here that the suffragette Ethel Moorhead became the first in Scotland to be force-fed, a practice which came later north of the border. \"There were two prisons in Scotland that did force feed,\" says Donna Moore of the Glasgow Women's Library. \"One was Edinburgh,\" she continues \"although slightly reluctantly, but the main one was Perth and, in fact, when there was a royal visit to Perth there were signs outside saying welcome to your majesty's torture chamber in Perth prison.\" Ms Moore is fascinated by the stories of suffragettes, stories which she feels deserve to be better known. Earlier in the year a group of women took part in a public art event, called \"March of Women\", from the Glasgow Women's Library to Glasgow Green. The idea was to celebrate women's history and achievements, past and present. The site was chosen as the green had been the venue for many rallies and marches by both suffragettes and suffragists. World War One is often credited with bringing some women the vote in 1918. But Norman Watson says \"in many respects we forget about the valuable work that the constitutionalists did, the non-militant women\". He reckons there were perhaps 100 plus militant suffragettes in Scotland, but thousands who were pursuing similar aims but by different means. \"My view is that by 1914 when the worst of the forcible feeding was happening I think we were heading towards the government giving in, and I actually think the women might have got the vote in 1916, two years before they did.\"", "question": "From throwing an egg at Winston Churchill , to a huge suffrage march in Edinburgh , to the @placeholder of force - feeding , Scotland 's suffragettes and the more gradualist suffragists were an important part of the fight for women 's votes .", "option_0": "core", "option_1": "horrors", "option_2": "start", "option_3": "practice", "option_4": "lure", "label": 1}
{"article": "Data from Education DataLab shows about 20,000 secondary pupils left before they sat their GCSE exams. If the students had remained, some schools would not have scored as highly on the official league tables. Of the 100 schools in England which would have seen the biggest shift, 62 were in London. The figures are from 2,901 state-funded secondary schools in England across four years. Education Datalab, an independent research group, recalibrated the results according to how long each pupil spent in each school. Each pupil should spend 15 terms in secondary education. For example, if a pupil spent six terms in one school, then that school would receive 40% of the results, while the other 60%. Currently, league tables are worked out from how many children were on-roll in January of their final year. Children may leave school because of being managed out, expulsions or moving house. They are also more likely to be from poorer backgrounds or have special educational needs. The figures show Harris Academy Greenwich would have seen the biggest impact on its league table position. One year it would have seen its GCSE pass rates for grades A-C drop by 15%. In the last four years 611 pupils completed their secondary education at the school, while 217 left before the January of their final year. Nine out of the bottom 100 were also Harris Academies. A Harris Federation spokesperson said many of its schools joined the federation because they were failing and had a high proportion of pupils considered to be disadvantaged. \"London - which is where all of our schools are located - has high pupil mobility. It is no surprise that this would be even higher in recently failing schools with very large catchment areas and in areas of disadvantage,\" the spokesperson added. But Philip Nye from Education Datalab said there were some weaknesses in the league table system and that it could be improved by making schools accountable for all children. \"We do think in a minority of cases there might be some head teachers who are using pupil moves to boost their league table moves,\" he added. A Department for Education spokesperson said exclusions could only be issued on disciplinary grounds and that it was introducing stronger measures to ensure mainstream schools continue to be accountable for the progress of pupils they place in alternative provision.

TfL said more police have been deployed in accident hotspots and it is focusing on motorcycle and scooter safety. The figures were released as the London Assembly committee published its report â€˜Easy Rider: Improving motorcycle safety on London roadsâ€™. Researchers spoke to 1,200 riders and found one in five had been involved in a collision and about 62% motorcyclists had been involved in a near-miss incident. In 2010, 4,337 motorcyclists were injured in London, which by 2014 rose to 5,233, an increase of nearly 21%. The report found the inconsistency over access to bus lanes causes \"unnecessary confusion\" as TfL allows motorcyclists to ride in bus lanes on the roads it manages, while many boroughs do not. It also asked TfL to monitor the impact of dedicated Cycle Superhighways on the road space shared by other traffic. The report also called on authorities to educate young riders. Valerie Shawcross, chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee, said: \"Arguably motorcyclists have been overlooked in public discussion about road safety in recent years. \"However, 36 motorcyclists were killed on London's roads last year, a death toll that is unacceptably high, and part of a bigger picture of collisions and injuries affecting motorcyclists, many of them life-changing in their seriousness.\" TfL said that since September police had stopped 5,389 riders, issued 742 traffic offence reports, 1,335 verbal warnings, seized 96 motorcycles and made 10 arrests. Police will also target the boroughs where motorcyclists are at greatest risk of injury.

{"article": "He takes charge of Saturday's meeting between Celtic and Aberdeen, but for a time last year was not sure if he would continue officiating. \"The surgeon said I should focus on going back to work in a normal job,\" Madden said. \"The cup final wasn't what I was thinking about, it was my well-being.\" The official was first diagnosed before last summer's European Championships in France, but delayed treatment so that he could be part of the team assisting fellow Scottish referee Willie Collum at the finals. Madden started this season, then went for surgery after taking charge of Celtic's 4-1 win over Aberdeen in August. He returned to refereeing two months later. \"Only when I was first diagnosed,\" replied Madden after being asked if he thought his career may be over. \"I realised very quickly after the surgery that everything had gone well and that I would go back to refereeing. Whether I thought I would come back as quickly as I did, maybe not so. That was due to the care I was given and the focus and support around me. \"I took the decision in December 2015 to focus totally on my refereeing and I gave up my job because of the demands of domestic and international football.

{"article": "\"Varying\" could take taxes down, but we're not hearing much about that happening. Conservatives would like to lower them over the next parliament, but don't want deeper spending cuts to make them appear even more austere than George Osborne. A significant contribution their tax commission has made is to suggest Scotland could have another tier of income tax, between the basic and higher rate, taxing some income at, say, 30%. Depending how it is designed, that is most likely to affect those earning in the thirty and forty thousands zone. If it is not to increase tax on some, it will only apply to a new tranche of earnings over £42,400. Among other parties, the debate is skewed towards using the new powers to raise income tax rates - to \"end austerity\" or \"protect public services\". It is making this election campaign very different from before. Labour is arguing that the Scottish Rate of Income Tax should go up in the 2016-17 financial year. That's this April. The legislation newly in force, for the year ahead, does not give MSPs the ability to have varied increases on different bands. So Labour says Finance Secretary John Swinney should raise tax by 1 pence across all bands, and then hand a £100 rebate to those earning under £20,000. It's made for some lively exchanges between the two parties. But perhaps they're... well, a bit phoney. Both sides are right, with Labour's claim that its policy would be progressive: higher earners suffer more pain, which isn't quite what the SNP had been arguing. The SNP is right in its counter-claim that the plan would take more tax from those of modest means: earning £20,001, where you get no rebate, still puts you about five grand under the average skilled workers' salary. It's far from clear that Holyrood can pay a tax rebate, either legally or practically. If it can, it may be taxable - an absurd £20 tax on a tax rebate (for which perhaps there should be a rebate). Then expert analysis by week's end showed that the rebate is a poorly targeted support for low earners. Around a tenth of it would go to around 100,000 people living in the 20% of households with the highest total earnings (such as higher earners' spouses with part-time jobs). But perhaps the most phoney element is political. The SNP has a Holyrood majority, and it isn't going to make such a radical amendment to the current Budget Bill - not just before an election, and least of all because Labour says it should. Even if Labour were to return to power after May's election, it would have to wait until next year to implement tax changes. That's when Holyrood is on track to have more flexibility for setting bands with thresholds, setting rates and re-distributing the tax burden. No more need for that rebate. It's clear that the SNP (though the leadership has not explicitly spelled it out yet) will have something along those lines in its manifesto too, to be implemented after the powers come in. So it's likely that the sound and fury of recent days may turn into a broad tax-raising consensus - including Liberal Democrats, but not Tories - by the time their manifestos are published. That sound and fury has drowned out some of the interesting messages from two studies published on Friday by public finance experts - one from the Resolution Foundation, the other by Professor David Bell and David Eiser at the Centre for Constitutional Change. Also worth a read is Gavin Kelly's blog. He is a former Downing Street adviser and Resolution Foundation director who chairs the Living Wage Commission. Here are five observations that struck me: The reverse is also true, so tax-cutters beware: take £1 off the tax bill of those on Universal Credit, and it reduces their benefit entitlement by 67 pence. Plus, that UK welfare reform is itself fiercely complicated, and two benefits systems will probably have to run in parallel for some time. As Gavin Kelly points out, this is about policy coherence. Once Scotland's politicians have got their heads around income tax, its interaction with the benefits system and with national insurance looks likely to be the next battle-front with Westminster.", "question": "Who wins and who loses ?

It is a completely different world to the one in which he first forged a career in the sport. Burgess made his Super League debut at 17 with Bradford Bulls, then coached by Steve McNamara, the current England boss. At the same time as attempting to make the big step-up from academy rugby, the teenager was caring for his terminally ill father Mark. \"His dad's death made him a man,\" McNamara recalls. \"His maturity was beyond his years. \"He was going through a really tough period of his life, which tells you a bit about his tremendous character, to come through this adversity and be both a great player and a great person. He came through it with a tremendous amount of credit. It was beyond belief what he did.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Mark, himself a former rugby league player and coach, deteriorated in health rapidly and passed away aged 45. Sam has spoken of how this tragedy toughened him up, and gave him the strength to make bold decisions for himself. It is no surprise, therefore, that after leaving for Australia on his own, he is now willing to leave his three brothers and mum Julie in Sydney to return to the UK for a new challenge. Yet under that tough exterior is a pretty sensitive bloke. Burgess broke down in tears before his Rabbitohs debut when Crowe gave him a club membership card bearing his father Mark's name. \"He is a tremendous person,\" says McNamara, with whom Burgess spoke last week to explain his reasons for quitting league. \"He's an energiser - he brings energy to any group. He has a great personality, a strong personality, is very strong minded and strong willed. \"He is a great carer of other people. He will be a big asset to Bath Rugby and, hopefully, England if he makes it.\" Having spoken to McNamara, and former team-mates at England and Bradford, few have a bad word to say against the player or the man. Interestingly, England rugby union head coach Stuart Lancaster rates these qualities as highly as his rugby skills. Tall, heavy, lean, quick. Very powerful and skilful. He will break the line a lot in union, bend the line and poke his nose through the other side \"Clearly he is a world-class player, but what impressed me more was his maturity, his leadership, his mental toughness, his ability to inspire his team-mates,\" Lancaster says. \"Anyone who goes to Australia when they are 18 years old to try to find a tough level of competition because he wants to challenge himself, says something about the individual.\" Some league fans may feel betrayed that a player developed within the sport now takes those skills away to benefit another game. But Burgess knows how short life is, and how a career is even shorter. He has challenges and goals to achieve and has no problem in thinking for himself. As a player, he is a born leader. Always the most highly rated of the four brothers, Sam took no time in making his impact at Bradford. His Super League debut came in 2006, a year that also saw him named senior academy player of the year. A powerful first full season with the Bulls in 2007 yielded immediate recognition, with a Great Britain Test debut try following his young player award. Kevin Sinfield, England captain: \"Absolutely without doubt one of the best players I've ever worked with. Top player, top bloke.\" Eorl Crabtree, England teammate: \"I personally think he should do what the hell he wants. One life, one crack at it.\" Keith Senior, former GB and Leeds centre: \"I'd do the same and don't fault him. A massive opportunity and he's still young enough to do more in both codes.\" The 2009 move to Sydney marked a transformation from hard-running Super League forward to hard-hitting NRL machine. England's man of the tournament by an absolute mile in last autumn's league World Cup, he was the team's on-field heartbeat. His playing style should excite union fans. He has a ridiculous combination of bulk and athleticism. The obvious comparison is New Zealand's dual code phenomenon Sonny Bill Williams. Indeed, when a teenage Burgess made his Bulls debut eight years ago, Bradford team-mate Shontayne Hape - a Kiwi league international and future England union convert - predicted just that. \"I reckon he's going to be Great Britain's Sonny Bill,\" said Hape in 2006. \"He's going to be one of the best.\" Fast forward to February 2014, from the Yorkshire village of Odsal to Twickenham, and the England rugby union head coach. \"Sonny Bill Williams is a rugby league forward playing as a union back,\" says Lancaster. \"That's a much easier transition and is probably the closest comparison.\" McNamara, who has coached Burgess as both man and boy and seen the transformation from raw Bradford Bull to commanding international enforcer, calls him the ultimate physical specimen. \"Tall, heavy, lean, quick. Very powerful and skilful,\" he says. \"He will break the line a lot in union, bend the line and poke his nose through the other side. \"He's ferocious defensively and hits very, very hard. A great player and a great person.\" For a man who thrives on the big occasion and under the media spotlight, Burgess is desperate for his World Cup gamble to pay off. If he misses it, then swapping Sydney's bright lights and a shot at NRL Grand Final glory for three years of club union in Bath may prove a tough adjustment. Yet anyone who has seen him play league would back him to crack union, too - whatever the odds.", "question": "Sam Burgess is a rugby freak .

{"article": "It hopes to unearth the detailed history of what has been described as the \"best preserved\" World War One internment camp in the world. It was home to up to 4,500 German prisoners of war during the conflict. Dr Chris Bowles, Scottish Borders Council's archaeologist, said the project was important as without it the story of the camp could be lost. The site was acquired by the UK government from the owners of the Stobs Castle Estate in 1902 and the following year it was established as the main training base for British soldiers in Scotland, hosting 20,000 soldiers in its first full year. However, usage tailed off during the following decade and its future was in doubt until the outbreak of war in 1914 when it started a new role. Dr Bowles started a project proposal for the area several years ago, having identified the potential of the site. \"This really is a huge project, and will be one of the biggest archaeology projects in Scotland,\" he said. \"Stobs Camp is of international significance because of the excellent state of preservation of some of its infrastructure - it is the best preserved First World War internment camp in the world and was the headquarters of the POW camp system in Scotland. \"This project is important as without it there is a real danger that the story of Stobs will be lost and the buildings that remain deteriorate further.\" He said the aim was to develop a management plan for the site, improve access for visitors and create interpretation materials, including an app, to make sure the important role of the site was remembered. Dr Bowles said: \"Stobs was used to house POWs for over five years, stretching on until after the war was officially over, and during that time around 45 POWs died in the camp from various ailments, despite there being a hospital on site. \"The camp commandant allowed the prisoners to create a cemetery, which still exists, although in the early 1960s the bodies were all exhumed and reburied in a German war graves cemetery in Staffordshire.\" Prisoners built a cairn to remember their comrades at Stobs and also planted a ring of yew trees behind the memorial. However, the memorial was destroyed and the Stobs camp was decommissioned by the army in the 1960s. As part of the new project, the Borders Family History Society is tracing the ancestors of the German soldiers and seamen interred at Stobs. It also aims to restore the cairn and host a special ceremony on Armistice Day 2018, on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One. Andrew Jepson from Archaeology Scotland, the Stobs Camp project officer, said: \"Stobs Camp has a fascinating story to tell, and so far we have only just scratched the surface. \"We are now very much at the start of what will be an exciting journey of discovery. \"Along with our team of volunteers we will now be able to conduct a detailed survey of the POW camp, record the camp buildings and undertake targeted excavation.\" The project has been supported by SBC, Historic Environment Scotland, the Hawick Archaeological Society, Borders Family History Society, Live Borders and other local partners.

Owner Dietrich Mateschitz has said he will pull the team out of the sport if they do not get it. But Ferrari's position is that at this late stage they do not have the logistical or technical capacity to give 2016 engines to Red Bull in addition to their other two customers, Sauber and the new Haas team. F1 insiders have raised the possibility of Red Bull carrying on with Renault despite everything - their existing deal has not been completely terminated and it runs to the end of 2017. But the two parties have fallen out following the collapse of trust on both sides, and reviving their relationship would be difficult.

He could take home as much as £499,999, making him the top-earning presenter at BBC Northern Ireland, and the papers give more than a dozen pages between them to discussing the sum. The Daily Mirror runs an \"exclusive\" saying that the north Belfast man has turned down an offer of £1m from a rival commercial broadcaster. The two-year contract would've allowed him to cut his workload by half but would've doubled his money, the paper reports. An unnamed friend of the TV and radio presenter tells the paper why he turned it down, saying: \"His ambition was always to work for the Beeb and for now it still is. \"But he's not daft - the doors to other opportunities are never closed.\" Nolan himself confirms to the News Letter that he has rejected more lucrative offers of work from other companies because the BBC offers a \"very special platform\". \"I don't want to come across as arrogant but the factual position is I have been offered more money for less work,\" he says, adding that he won't elaborate on other approaches \"because it would break confidences\". In its editorial, the paper says many people will be \"outraged\" by the size of his salary but plenty of others \"will think he is worth it\". \"Mr Nolan maddens listeners and viewers as much as he delights them, but the simple fact is that he has transformed that mid-morning Radio Ulster slot and made it one of the most popular shows in the history of the station,\" it says. \"Mr Nolan is such a colourful personality that when he is off his radio show it loses some of its edge.\" Flick through the Belfast Telegraph and you'll find a full five pages, plus two opinion pieces on BBC pay-packets, with much of the focus on Nolan. Claire McNeilly delves into his background, saying his success has been a \"classic rags to riches story\". \"Lest we forget, this particular fat cat who got the cream was once an impoverished little kitten,\" she writes, explaining that the \"wee boy from the Shankill\" was the \"son of a man who earned a pittance working in a factory for 40 years\".

The worries come after windows in a block of apartments in south Belfast was cracked by the heat of a loyalist bonfire last week.

{"article": "Ansaru was formed in January 2012, though it rose to prominence only about six months later through the release of a video in which it vowed to attack Westerners in defence of Muslims worldwide. \"For the first time, we are glad to announce to the public the formation of this group that has genuine basis,\" said a statement issued by the group in January 2012 and quoted in local media. \"We will have [a] dispassionate look into everything, to encourage what is good and see to its spread and to discourage evil and try to eliminate it.\" Its full Arabic name, Jama'atu Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis Sudan, means: \"Vanguards for the Protection of Muslims in Black Africa\". This suggests that it has a wider regional agenda, with the UK listing Ansaru as a \"terrorist group\" linked to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Just two months after it was formed, the UK said the militant group had killed a Briton and an Italian taken hostage in the north-western state of Sokoto after a failed attempt to rescue them. Then in December 2012, it abducted French national Francis Colump, 63, following an attack on a well-guarded compound in the northern town of Rimi, about 25km (15 miles) from Katsina city. About 30 Ansaru gunmen used dynamite to force their way into the compound, seizing Mr Colump who, officials, said, was working on a wind power project. It carried out a similar attack in February 2013, capturing seven foreign nationals from a housing compound owned by the Lebanese construction company Setraco. It said the attack was to avenge \"transgressions\" by European nations in Mali and Afghanistan, where Western forces are battling Islamist insurgents. On Saturday, it released a video saying it had killed the \"Christian\" hostages because the UK and Nigerian forces were planning an operation to rescue them - an allegation the UK denied. It has also carried out attacks on Nigerian targets. In January 2013, Ansaru said it had carried out an attack which killed two Nigerian soldiers as they prepared to deploy to Mali. The group said it targeted the troops because the Nigerian military was joining the French-led military campaign to \"demolish the Islamic empire of Mali\". French journal Jeune Afrique-L'Intelligent says Ansaru is led by the little-known Abu Ussamata al-Ansary. It quoted a statement by him as saying that the Nigerian government was \"incapable of defending Muslims in inter-religious violence with Christians\". The group also said it was fighting to reclaim \"the lost dignity of Muslims of black Africa\" and the creation of an Islamic caliphate from Niger to Cameroon and northern Nigeria. Analysts believe it is an off-shoot of Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency in 2009 to create an Islamic state in Nigeria, rather than across the region. \"To some, the sect headed by Ansary is seen as one that will compliment the 'struggle' by the Boko Haram sect under Imam Abubakar Shekau but to many it is an indication that all is not well with the leadership of the Boko Haram sect and that there has been conflict about its ideology and its understanding of Islam,\" wrote journalist Tukur Mamu in Nigeria's Desert Herald newspaper last year. \"Hence, the decision to form a new group.\" According to Nigeria's Standard newspaper, Ansaru has denounced Boko Haram's style of operation as \"inhuman to the Muslim ummah [nation]\", an apparent reference to killing of innocent Nigerians - Christian and Muslim - through bombings and assassinations. \"Islam forbids killing of innocent people, including non-Muslims. This is our belief and we stand for it,\" Mr al-Ansary said in the video released last year. But Mr al-Ansary added that non-Muslims can be killed \"in self-defence or if they attack Muslims\", which seems to explain the killing of Nigerian soldiers to be deployed to Mali. However, analysts say it does not justify the killing of civilian hostages - unless Ansaru holds them accountable for the actions of Western governments in countries such as Mali, Iraq and Afghanistan. Analysts believe that Nigeria's government will find it more difficult to end the Islamist insurgency now that two groups are operating. The government is said to be working with counter-terrorism experts from several countries - including the US and UK - in an attempt to neutralise the threat posed by Boko Haram and Ansaru, amid fears that they could worsen instability across West and central Africa.", "question": "Nigeria 's militant Islamist group Ansaru has proved to be a formidable threat during its short existence , using dynamite to @placeholder heavily - fortified compounds and taking foreigners hostage - seven of whom it said it had killed on Saturday .", "option_0": "penetrate", "option_1": "employ", "option_2": "deliver", "option_3": "join", "option_4": "deter", "label": 0}

This has changed my life enormously, I am so grateful for the decision made by you. You were able to make a decision to donate your child's organs while going through such a traumatic time yourself. I will always remember you and have often been in awe of your decision. I am 49, married, a mum to a lively 9-year-old and I'm still a nurse. None of this would have been possible without your amazing gift of life. My transplant birthday is 31 August which we celebrate every year - 23 this year! Pauline Dear Type 1 Diabetes, You arrived completely out of nowhere. A horrible monster that has taken up residence with my son. You're aggressive and harmful and you won't go away. You follow my son everywhere. You're there when he eats, you're there when he plays, when he goes to school, and even while he sleeps. I can't control you monster, I can only adapt everything in my life to cater for you and \"manage\" your existence. Why couldn't you have chosen me instead of my sweet innocent child? I wish I could take you from my son but I can't. Instead, I watch your every move. I anticipate your next attack, and prepare to manage your fury. We feed you insulin several times a day. Sometimes that's enough but sometimes there's no telling what you will do next. There are no rules. You keep quiet for a while and just as I think I have got some kind of control you will strike! We got a machine that makes the balance between life and monster less painful but it's still there, forever waiting. I pray that you will leave and never come back. The new machine allows me days where I can almost forget that you're here, and then other days where I catch myself looking at my beautiful boy carrying this heavy monster on his back and it makes me weep. I almost mourn the past. The freedom and innocence that have gone will never return. I check my son regularly to see what damage has been caused by the monster who chose to live with us. Daily we prepare for battle. Daily we pray for an antidote that will kill the monster and free my son of its burden. For now, my son is strong and wise but I fear the day he leaves our home to live on his own with the monster. A parent wants to protect their child, but I have to watch as my son battles 24-hours-a-day. This is his life. I can only stand on the sidelines and offer my support and my love. I wish I could offer a cure and rid my baby of this horrible monster. I wish it had chosen me. Angie Dear Father, This letter is a small way to say \"thank you\" for changing my identity forever. When you travelled as a young man from Bangladesh to the UK in the 1960s, leaving your family behind to make a better life for yourself, little did you know the effect it would have on me. When you arrived with a single suitcase, a five pound note and a London address scribbled on a piece of paper, you were taking a big risk. You got a teaching job and integrated as much as possible, notwithstanding the racism of 60s London. You went back to Bangladesh, only to marry my mother, and returned to the UK where my brother and I were born. You wanted us to be British and give us opportunities you never had. You made sure we went to British Universities and have a solid British identity. Although I have a Bengali heritage, which I am very proud of, it is hard for me to claim that I am (with any true meaning) a Bengali. Whilst you took me to Bangladesh several times growing up, it was only for the summer holidays; we never lived there and (in the nicest way) I was treated like a foreigner by my family there. I cannot claim that being Bengali is a major part of my identity, maybe around 10%. The other 90%, I feel British. Give me the \"cricket test\" any day, I'd always choose England. Even though our identities may clash sometimes, your move changed who I am today. So thank you. Your forever grateful younger son. Riad Dear Accident, It was a sunny morning in Cambridge when you changed me.  Crushed but still whole, injured but not dead, damaged but not broken. You challenged me to push my body and mind to their absolute limits as I learnt to walk again three times, when I had to escape the depths of post traumatic stress and when I had to learn to live in the world again. But out of all the pain and adversity, you taught me strength and perseverance. I took the negative and made it positive. I saw how much love was around me that I should never take for granted. You propelled me to push my limits, take risks and never say no. I explored the world, made friends for life and spread my wings like never before. Accident, as much as you hurt me and those closest to me, I have to say thank you. You have made me the strong, independent person I am today. So yes, you changed me, but I am a better person for it. Yours sincerely Sheena Dear Salsa, You changed me. I arrived in London almost six years ago, a young shy Italian woman, with some confidence in her brains and not much confidence in her social or physical skills. Before I met you I didn't really like it here. I found it difficult to meet people and make friends, the city seemed cold and indifferent. I felt, once more, like the odd one out, and wasn't too positive about my future. But then you came along, and amazingly enough you brought with you many smart, funny, sociable and caring people! While dancing I found out it was so easy to start a conversation, make a joke, share a smile. Through your happy, strong beat you showed me how to let go of all my daily worries and stress and just follow the music, follow my lead, follow my body, for hours and hours, five days a week. You opened up doors to me that I didn't even know existed. Now we don't see each other anymore, but that doesn't mean I forgot about you and what you did for me. You will always be my first English (Cuban) love. Marta Dear Epilepsy, When you first arrived I was twelve years old. From a social butterfly to a bedbound haze in a flash. The rules changed and strange new ones became habit: Never bathe alone, walk on the inside of the street, carry limited cash, don't lock the bathroom door and don't go anywhere by yourself. I was told that I wouldn't be able to work or drive. No dignity, no answers, no certainties. A boyfriend? A family? We will see. Children? Maybe. You may overwhelm me frequently but you will not overwhelm my life. I follow the rules you impose in order to be safe. You turned my world upside down but part of me remained. I'm not a teacher as I wished but I have a job and a husband. Soon I hope to have a family. I must be realistic - some dreams aren't meant to be but we'll see. My dreams and aspirations are those which \"normal\" people just have. They aren't wild or imaginative but you've made sure I appreciate the normality I was told I'd never have. You've shaped and enhanced me. Now I'm a fighter - wiser, sympathetic and stronger. I don't despise you as I once did, the hatred has been channelled into a will to defeat you. I now spend my days defeating you rather than being defeated by you. I'll see you again soon. Or maybe not.

{"article": "Kickstarter responded in a creative way - by commissioning an investigative journalist to find out what went wrong. Now his report has been published. Mark Harris, a technology writer based in Seattle, travelled to South Wales, spent six weeks speaking to as many people as he could reach and produced an epic account of the history of the Zano. In more than 13,000 words he describes the origins of the Torquing Group, a business that was essentially the personal mission of self-taught engineer Ivan Reedman to build a marketable drone; how clever -  though misleading - marketing turned the Zano into a Kickstarter sensation, galloping past its original funding target; and then the disaster which unfolded as Reedman and his colleagues discovered they just did not have the skills or the experience to mass produce the mini-drone. It is the backers for whom this work was designed and many of them will be hoping for a smoking gun to reinforce their belief that the whole project was just a scam to get them to part with their money. They will be disappointed. Mr Harris concludes that this was case of foul-up, not foul play. \"Torquing's directors managed their business poorly and spent the Kickstarter money too freely, but I've found no evidence that any of them ended up rich on the backs of the crowd,\" concluded Harris. He does raise serious questions about the video which excited so much interest in the project. Reedman denies that CGI, other drones or even selfie sticks were used to create a misleading picture of what the Zano could do but admits that the video shows features that were not operational at the time it was shot. In fact, as I found when I came to shoot a demo of the project last August, the Zano never delivered what was promised in the video. But it was not only potential backers who swallowed exaggerations in the marketing campaign. Kickstarter chose Zano as a \"staff pick\" and the tech news site Engadget shortlisted it for its best of CES 2015 award, even though the Torquing team could not demonstrate the drone flying at the show. As late as October, Popular Science chose it as one of its 100 most amazing innovations of 2015. The writer does not accuse the Torquing team of dishonesty but says that as production problems mounted and the money began to run out they showed \"a dangerous lack of self-awareness of the problems the company was making for itself\". Harris has only managed to speak on the record to Reedman, but he concludes that neither he nor the other members of the team \"possessed the technical or commercial competencies necessary to deliver the Zano as specified in the original campaign\". But the most significant lessons to be drawn from his account are for Kickstarter. The crowdfunding platform, which paid for his work, was allowed to look at the finished article before publication but not to change anything. He says all crowdfunding platforms need to reconsider the way they deal with projects involving complex hardware, massive overfunding, or large sums of money. He wants them to look at bringing in mentors to advise projects like Zano which suddenly find themselves taking on far more than they had planned. He also wants Kickstarter to be far more explicit about the nature of the risk backers are taking - and more active in weeding out weak projects before they are funded. Harris interviewed Kickstarter's co-founder Yancey Strickler and though he appears to find a few of the suggestions helpful, he is robust in rejecting most of the criticisms. He says that while the platform does have rules about realistic videos showing a genuine prototype, they are hard to enforce. Tightening up the rules can only go so far, he argues, and it is essential for backers to understand that it is up to them to evaluate a project. \"If you want 100% success with hardware and new products, I think the only solution is that you just shop on Amazon,\" he adds. And in the end, Harris seems to agree. If we want an alternative to banks and venture capital as a funding source for high-risk tech start-ups, he says, we may have to accept the occasional Zano alongside the Pebbles and Oculus Rifts. Now, some of the thousands of people who lost money backing this doomed project will look cynically at a piece of journalism funded by the very organisation they see as partly responsible for their losses. But what Harris - and Kickstarter - have produced is a valuable contribution to our understanding of the risky nature of any technology hardware start-up.", "question": "When Europe 's biggest Kickstarter project , the Zano mini-drone , crashed to @placeholder last November there was plenty of blame to go round .

{"article": "Newspapers said RAF Tornados in Iraq had been fitted with heat-seeking missiles designed for aerial combat. But the Ministry of Defence said there was \"absolutely no truth\" in this. The Foreign Office said concern about Russian military action in Syria had been reiterated by the attache. Prime Minister David Cameron has previously said Russian military intervention in Syria is helping only to support \"the butcher\", President Bashar al-Assad. He has also expressed concerns that Russian forces are not discriminating between air strikes on Islamic State (IS) militants and others fighting the Syrian president. The RAF has been carrying out air strikes against IS militants in Iraq since the action was approved by MPs in 2014, but UK military intervention in Syria has not been backed in Parliament. By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent, BBC News This curious footnote to the air campaign being waged over Iraq and Syria illustrates the potential for misunderstanding now that Russia is conducting major independent operations of its own. RAF Tornados based in Cyprus are carrying out air strikes only in Iraq, though potentially could be flying over Syria on intelligence gathering missions as well. Either way, en route to or from Iraq, they could come into close proximity with Russian warplanes. However, the Ministry of Defence in London has denied any suggestion that they are being armed with air-to-air missiles so as to defend themselves in any encounter. The Russian government called in the British air attache in Moscow after reading erroneous reports in the British press suggesting air-to-air missiles were being fitted. What is Russia's endgame in Syria? The battle for Iraq and Syria in maps A Foreign Office spokesman said the defence attache met Russian ministry of defence officials on Sunday. \"The Russian government sought clarification over inaccurate newspaper reports concerning RAF rules of engagement in Iraq,\" the Foreign Office spokesman said. \"The defence attache reiterated the British government's concerns about Russia's military operation in Syria, including targeting legitimate opposition groups, using unguided weaponry and leading to large numbers of civilian deaths.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin has defended the military operations in Syria, saying the aim is to \"stabilise the legitimate authority\" of Mr al-Assad. He denied that Russian air strikes were hitting moderate opposition groups rather than IS militants. Mr Putin told Russian state TV that Moscow also wanted to \"create conditions for a political compromise\" in Syria. In 2013, British MPs voted against action in Syria, amid claims - denied by President Assad - that he was using chemical weapons against his own people. Now the government wants to extend its bombing campaign against IS militants from Iraq into Syria, but says it will only do so with Parliamentary approval.

{"article": "Matthew Eteson denies the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster and her daughter Lauren Thornton. The pair died on a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Preston Crown Court heard Mr Eteson had fabricated the exhaust system of an onboard petrol-driven generator. A statement from the 42-year-old, of Hale, Greater Manchester, was read out in court describing how the generator was used to power the boat's mains appliances. The court was told he had taken the generator off the boat to make moderations by fitting it with a silencer because it was noisy for neighbours.

{"article": "There have been cheers and jubilation in the US and elsewhere in the West, but capital cities around the world are already bracing for the repercussions of Bin Laden's killing. Hundreds of dedicated and would-be jihadis will be mourning and swearing to give their lives in revenge for his death at the hands of US special forces in the city of Abbottabad. There is little doubt that the death of Bin Laden is a huge blow to al-Qaeda. But at the same time the network has moved over the years from a highly centralised hierarchy - with recruiting, training and orders all scrutinised by its top leaders - to something much more loose and amorphous. Today al-Qaeda's philosophy is one man, one bomb. It does not need another 9/11 to make its mark. One bomb in Times Square in New York placed by a dedicated suicide bomber or a bomb in a New York subway - both attacks were attempted in in recent years -  are big enough indicators that al-Qaeda is alive and kicking. Al-Qaeda has been a franchise for many years. Anyone can join it by planting a bomb somewhere. Almost anyone can come to Pakistan or Afghanistan and be offered training with key al-Qaeda allies such as the Pakistani Taliban or the Afghan group headed by Jalaluddin Haqqani. The facilitator in Pakistan's cities has been Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) - a banned militant group which previously fought in Kashmir but now attacks many different targets and helps al-Qaeda. After 9/11 it helped hide many senior al-Qaeda figures and it may well have played a major role in hiding Bin Laden. Pakistan has refused to go up against al-Qaeda allies like Haqqani because they were operating in Afghanistan not Pakistan. Likewise, allies like LeT are close to Pakistan's intelligence services because their main target is Kashmir and India. Thus the threat is there. Before 9/11 there were no known al-Qaeda cells in Europe except for the one in Hamburg which launched those attacks. However, today every single European country has an al-Qaeda cell. Hundreds of Muslims with European passports have travelled to Pakistan's tribal areas for training and returned to Europe. After the arrest of three Moroccans in Germany last week for planning to plant bombs in public places, German authorities admit that over 200 German citizens have had training in the tribal areas and many of them have returned to Germany. The same is the case in Britain, Scandinavia, France, Spain and Italy. The fear now of random suicide bombings in subway or train stations in the US or Europe is particularly high. So is the threat of plane hijackings and bombings of Western military targets and embassies in the Middle East, where they are already a frequent target. There is also the possibility of the amateur jihadi placing a bomb in a supermarket. Other kinds of attacks are also likely. Some may be carried out by dedicated long-term jihadis who have been placed amid Western societies and who now may spring into action with a plot and target that they have been working on for years. Such lone attackers have been found in the US before, with individuals travelling to the tribal areas for training and then returning to a major US city and trying to carry out an attack. These have usually been foiled by law enforcement agencies at the last moment. Afghanistan, Pakistan and India are also particularly at risk from more organised attacks. In the former, the al-Qaeda influence among dedicated jihadis like the Haqqani group is still strong. Pakistan is also extremely vulnerable to attack. Despite a constant spate of denials from the Pakistani authorities - which have now been proven wrong - al-Qaeda recently had its base in Pakistan. Al-Qaeda and its affiliated Pakistani groups will be determined to launch a bombing campaign in Pakistan in memory of Bin Laden. This will heighten tensions in a country that is already beset with power shortages and an economic crisis. Finally al-Qaeda and its allies may find this the right moment to create major divisions between India and Pakistan by launching another Mumbai-style attack on Indian territory. This would aim to take the heat off the hunt for al-Qaeda members in Pakistan. The Middle East also remains a big vacuum for al-Qaeda because of the ongoing Arab revolt. It is still a prime target for al-Qaeda as it seeks to gain influence and clout among the new generation of leaders who have emerged in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and the Gulf states. But this task will be much more difficult after Bin Laden's death. Clearly Bin Laden's death will give intelligence agencies around the world many clues and leads to catch other leaders, but al-Qaeda will not disappear overnight.

{"article": "Whatever your perspective or personal views of what Mr Aamer is, was, or represents, his return to the UK was greeted with a collective sigh of relief across Whitehall. The 5,017 days of detention were not only a real point of tension in the critical transatlantic relationship; they also soured and compromised attempts by the government to reach out to some of the hardest-to-reach Muslim communities. In the short term, he will begin to receive expert medical help, including a psychiatric assessment. He will finally get to meet the son who was born on the day he arrived at Guantanamo Bay. But for some, Mr Aamer's return represents a risk. Davis Lewin, of the Henry Jackson Society, a security and foreign relations think tank, has urged the UK to think very carefully about how it manages and monitors him now he is back. Mr Aamer's legal team have said he will submit to whatever monitoring is required - although they also argue it is unnecessary because the case against him comes from unreliable allegations extracted during torture. If MI5 decides to monitor him, he may never know for sure that it is happening - such is the nature of that kind of work. There are bigger questions for the UK, questions of legacy and lessons to be learnt. Critics argue that in the wake of 9/11 the US was not the only country to lose its legal map and moral compass. London didn't seem to want to tell Washington that Guantanamo was a bad idea - and it didn't insist that any British men detained in Afghanistan be brought back to the UK. That, say critics, was a dereliction of long-standing British principles of justice. \"Human rights and justice and the rule of law are for everybody,\" says former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, a member of the cross-party group that lobbied Washington to release Mr Aamer. \"He has been denied that. Not only is that terrible for him, but we have to be better than that if we're going to defeat the scourge of terror and terrorism. \"We're going to have to rise above these things and stick to the rule of law, and accept that human rights belong to everyone.\" Some American interrogations involved intelligence material provided by Britain - and that could amount to complicity in torture. And so, many MPs are now pushing for real answers to questions about Britain's role in the weeks and months after 9/11. \"One of the things that it is absolutely essential that happens in due course is that [Shaker Aamer] looks the camera in the eye in Britain and says what happened to him,\" says Mr Mitchell. \"If as is alleged he was tortured, and if there was any UK involvement in that, we need to get to the bottom of that not only because it's utterly wrong if it was done in our name, but also because we need to ensure that these sort of circumstances don't happen to anyone else.\" But why haven't those answers come out yet? The government fought a mammoth legal battle to prevent courts disclosing the full extent of what ministers and officials knew about the transfer of men to Guantanamo. But the claimants ultimately accepted a multi-million pound settlement - meaning the government never had to disclose what happened. Parliament then passed the Justice and Security Act which allows ministers to apply to hear cases in secret - closing that door for good. Campaigners still hoped the facts would emerge in a full judge-led inquiry into complicity in rendition. The promised inquiry was shelved because there is still the possibility of criminal charges in relation to alleged rendition to Libya. So it is now down to the Intelligence and Security Committee to investigate. Earlier this week, the committee's new chair, Dominic Grieve QC, said he wanted to get started. The last detainee with a UK connection now has a long and complicated road ahead of him. He has to learn how to stop being Detainee 239 of Guantanamo Bay and become Shaker Aamer, father of four, of south-west London.

{"article": "On Saturday, sirens sounded for a third consecutive day warning of an incoming rocket fired from Gaza. People spending the Jewish Sabbath by the beach were sent rushing for cover. The Israeli military used its Iron Dome defence system to intercept and destroy the missile. A fifth battery had been added to it, just outside the city, only hours earlier. After the explosion, close to the coast, a small black cloud was left hanging in the sky over the sea. Tel Aviv is Israel's largest city and commercial centre but it is also a popular place to relax or party. However, despite the sunshine, outdoor restaurants, parks and pavements were much quieter over the weekend. It has taken a psychological adjustment for locals to realise that they too are now within the firing range of certain Palestinian rockets - believed to be the Iranian-made Fajr-5, which can reach up to 75km (45 miles). \"For Tel Aviv people this is a bit of a shock. The rockets hit all the time in the north and south of Israel but in Tel Aviv this never happens. I've lived here for ten years,\" said a jogger, Tzipi.

The money is part of a larger deal agreed on in May but depended on a number of reform conditions to be be fulfilled by Athens.

{"article": "In an exclusive interview with the BBC, the British corporate investigator who became embroiled in GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) China corruption scandal tells me his story is \"a cautionary tale which many people can learn from\". The risks of doing business in China, he says, are \"on the same scale as the opportunities\", and governments, including the British government, \"have not been doing a very thorough job of making business understand the risks\". \"Absolutely any company going to China could be the next party to suffer our fate if they fail to understand this,\" he says. The fate suffered by Peter Humphrey and his wife Yu Yingzeng was to spend two years in squalid and crowded jail cells, to be denied urgent medical attention and to be separated from each other and from their son. The corporate investigator says it was both a shattering experience and a miscarriage of justice. \"None of our staff did anything illegal,\" he told me. \"We engaged third parties to help us with some parts of our work. We always instructed them to follow legal means but had no control over the methods they used.\" So why the prosecution and the prison term? \"It doesn't stack up at all when you analyse our case and the GSK case on the basis of the information you have. It doesn't stack up at all.\" The couple were corporate investigators who became embroiled in a Chinese police investigation of corruption at GSK. The British pharmaceuticals giant had bribed Chinese doctors and hospitals to buy its medicines. Mr Humphrey and his wife were in no way implicated in that corruption, but had been hired by the company to investigate the source of a secretly filmed sex video of GSK's top boss in China and of whistleblower emails sent to company headquarters in London. \"I believe we were collateral damage in a wider dispute between a company and the authorities which led to us being dragged in,\" he said. Even now, Peter Humphrey is reluctant to discuss the details of the GSK case or of his relationship with his former client. Asked why, he tells me: \"It's not impossible that we may sue some of these parties or through other means try to seek redress.\" He says he watched the TV coverage of the GSK trial from his Shanghai prison cell. The company was found guilty of systematic bribery and fined Â£300m. He was shocked by the contrast between his punishment and theirs. \"Suspended jail sentences for three or four of the main culprits when I and my wife had been sentenced to years in prison,\" he says. \"Someone asked me recently why someone like Mark Reilly (GSK China's boss) could be set free and we were in jail. I think it's very simple, we don't have half a billion dollars. That story was about money from the beginning. Money got them into trouble and money got him out.\" The events which led to these trials took place in the early part of 2013 when China's new President Xi Jinping had just declared nationwide campaigns against corruption and for the rule of law. Peter Humphrey says that at the time he welcomed these developments: \"We felt hopeful that a new era with a genuine crackdown against corruption, had arrived. \"What we were doing for companies in the private sector was very similar to what the government now seemed to be doing in the public sector. Unfortunately though, when such a crackdown is driven in a sort of campaign style, throughout China's history in the past 60 or 70 years, we have seen that campaigns are often taken advantage of and used to conduct personal vendettas and I think that's what happened to us. Someone took offence and then orchestrated an act of personal revenge.\" Having been deported from China, Peter Humphrey does not know whether he'll ever be able to go back. His two years in prison do not erase his 40 year affection for the country. \"I love China. I love the Chinese people I've known over the years. I've had many positive memories and experiences. This does not erase them,\" he says. But once the investigator, always the investigator. From a world away in south-east England, Peter Humphrey needs to focus first on getting the medical treatment that he was denied in prison. But he is also determined to work out exactly what triggered his two year nightmare in Shanghai. \"I and my wife are not vengeful people. But we are angry because an injustice occurred.

{"article": "The Spanish-speaking film, starring Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal, is set in Chile in 1988, when a public referendum was called on Pinochet's 15-year coup-seized leadership. The people were to be asked to vote Yes for a continuation of Pinochet's rule or No for him to go. While the Yes campaigners go down a hackneyed route of vaunting Pinochet's great leadership and trashing the opposition, the No camp realise a radical new approach is needed. The people are scared and sceptical of a corrupt process and will take some persuading to even go to the polls. The answer is to hire advertising hotshot Rene Saavedra, who says they must harness the strategies of product advertising, namely the power of the positive message. \"Many people know how Pinochet got into power by overthrowing President Allende but very few know how he got out,\" says Bernal who plays Saavedra. \"Even I, who am from Latin America, didn't know about the campaign that went on. I didn't know how important publicity was to the movement and what actually went on. \"It was one of the most interesting things about the film and encouraged me to do it.\" Used to working on promotions for products such as fizzy drinks, Saavedra dismisses focusing on the atrocities of Pinochet's rule to take the sweet shop approach to the Nos' campaign: shiny imagery of rainbows and a beautiful future full of sun-soaked days of family fun. \"The film sees the birth of democracy in Chile through the eyes of a publicist,\" says Bernal. \"An archetypal publicist doesn't exist, but this character is fascinating because of his joyful attitude. \"He has a childish fascination with toys and things like his new microwave. These kind of things gave the character an interesting way to see the story.\" The No camp, a group made up of 16 political parties, are unsurprisingly unconvinced. But they pull together behind Saavedra in a spirit of unity and camaraderie. It's a dynamic that followed through into the cast, many of whom are the real-life members of the No campaign. \"There was the fraternal aspect to making the movie, which got me closer to the drama and to the freedom that that moment in history experienced,\" says Bernal. As for the members of the Yes campaign, they made a point of making themselves elusive. \"All the protagonists from the campaign were very up for making the movie. Some acted as themselves and others play their antagonists,\" says Bernal. \"They couldn't find people from the Yes campaign. There was only one person who was known but he didn't want to talk. A victory has many generals but a defeat has none.\" One of the original No team is Eugenio Garcia, on whom Bernal's character is based. Garcia, a smiling and gentle man, says he was taken aback when approached by Chilean director Pablo Larrain. \"It was a surprise for me as this happened 25 years ago and then I forgot, did my job and got on with my life,\" says Garcia. \"Now when I see the movie, it's very emotional.  It's a very good interpretation of how we all felt at the time, our fears and anticipation. It makes me remember all the emotions. It's beautiful.\" Meeting Garcia was a true honour and also valuable to understanding and playing Saavedra, say Bernal. It all adds to the film's air of authenticity, which Larrain has taken pains to achieve through the use of an old U-matic camera to help blend news footage from the era with the acting scenes. At heart, Saavedra is just a simple man of the people, deeply concerned for the young son who lives with him and longing to be reconciled with his estranged wife. When the Yes campaign hit back with underhand tactics, Saavedra feels the threats on a deeply personal level, rather than as part and parcel of the dirty game of politics. It sums up the other feeling pervading No: intimacy. This, Bernal explains, is down to Larrain.  No is the final part in Larrain's trilogy covering the Pinochet era. The first two films were Tony Manero and Post Mortem. No signals a closure for the director, who was a child at the time of the events of the film and whose parents were Yes voters. \"It's a film that is very personal to Pablo. He was 12 when this happened,\" says Bernal. \"It is, for him and other Chileans, a reconciliation, not just with society or the country, but with one's own history.\" Ultimately, the No campaign is triumphant. An unexpected 97% of registered voters turn out at the polls. The No campaign wins almost 56% of the vote. Pinochet stepped down in 1990 after losing democratic presidential and parliamentary elections. When he died in 2006, he was still to stand trial for human rights abuses, as ordered by the Chilean courts. This \"injustice\" is just one of the many issues that make No relevant to today's audience, says the politically-minded Bernal. But would he ever turn his interest into a career? \"I am very interested in politics,\" says the actor, who is a big supporter of human rights group Amnesty International. \"But as for going into it seriously in a formal way, I can't see that happening. Then again how many politicians have said the same?\" No is released in the UK on Friday, 8 February.

A 23-year-old Moroccan man given a suspended sentence for theft has become the first person convicted for his part in the spate of attacks. The man, named only as Younis A, was handed a six-month suspended sentence and a â‚¬100-euro (Â£79; $100) fine for stealing a mobile phone. Another Moroccan, aged 18, was given two years' probation and community service for stealing a bag, and a 22-year-old Tunisian was handed a three-month suspended sentence as well as community service. They are among 13 men who have been arrested for stealing. The attacks have been largely blamed on people from North Africa who entered Germany illegally or have sought asylum. Younis A sat with his head bowed so close to the table that his lawyer had to tell him to lift his chin and face the court. The young Moroccan admitted he had snatched a mobile phone from a young woman on New Year's Eve and stood briefly to mumble an apology in her direction. His lawyer told the court that he had had nothing to do with the sexual assaults that were perpetrated that night and accused the court of turning him into a scapegoat.

Misbehaviour masterclass \"We used to rip up work and make it 'snow' out the window, ignore teachers and keep chatting, put tacks on their seats, use it as choir practice, paint our nails, cornrow hair,\" says one former London comprehensive pupil, now a junior doctor. Some pupils collect detentions like trophies. \"We were the outlaws, the desperadoes, members of a bad-but-fun gang, playing cat and mouse with authority,\" says a former private school pupil. Another, remembering detentions in the 1980s, says: \"Collapsing of tables was a favourite for us. \"We had real ink pots and trestle tables, so all you had to do was kick the support on the table and the whole thing would collapse and then ink all over the floor. \"'Oops, sorry, don't know how that happened.'\" A former Hertfordshire comprehensive pupil, now in her 20s, says: \"We had so many, it turned into our after school club. \"One of the teachers gave up in the end. And the next time we were in, she put a film on. \"I think it was Romeo and Juliet, the Leonardo [DiCaprio] one. \"If we weren't in trouble, we would wait outside for the ones that were. \"One time I spent 100 minutes in a cupboard in the classroom with a friend. \"We weren't meant to be there, but it was cold outside and it seemed like a fun thing to do whilst we were waiting. \"They weren't a deterrent at all.\" What do you think? Join the conversation - find us on Facebook Forgetting to turn up Many teachers say detentions should take place on the day of the offence, when pupils will understand better why they are being punished. Same-day sanctions also improve pupils' chances of remembering the detention at all. In some schools, even if the original offence is small, such as wearing the wrong shoes, not turning up to detention can result in as much punishment as for someone who started a fight. \"Not a fair system,\" says one recent school leaver from Hillingdon. Confused parents Schools in England do not need permission from parents to impose detentions, and in most cases they are not even required to inform them. So the first they know is when their child is late home, and even then they might not find out why. \"Every other Monday over almost my entire 13th year, I told our parents I was at chess club, which worked well until they found out from talking to the parents of a fellow detainee who let the cat out of the bag,\" says one former London pupil. Another says: \"My mum was too busy to even know I had it half the time. \"So I didn't get into trouble at home.\" All for one Whole-class detentions are particularly controversial with better behaved class members. \"So all 30 of us had to stay behind for a couple of obnoxious people. This is so unfair. How does this help anyone?\" asks one school-leaver. \"Surely, in an ideal world teachers should ask the class for their opinions on the problem and work with them to find a fair and creative solution. How hard can it be?\" Socially useful Some schools make pupils on detention engage in socially useful activities such as litter picking the playground, which can be quite satisfying. And detention can be a chance to get all your homework done in one go, rather than having it last all week. But this approach can backfire too. \"One of the chores we were given to do sometimes in detention was to clean board-rubbers, which was basically a licence to get everything and everyone in sight covered in chalk dust,\" says a former pupil from Cheshire. Detention for teachers With lesson planning, marking and a dozen more extracurricular jobs at the end of the day, supervising an after-school detention is not fun for teachers. \"Deeply dull,\" says one. At some schools, pupils in detention must write an essay on \"what action they did wrong and what choices they have in the future when in that position\". This approach can \"often work\", say some teachers, but others disagree \"I loathed the idea of making children write for a punishment and taking away their valuable time when they could be running around in the sun or staring at ants in the grass,\" says one recent retiree, who never gave a detention in 36 years of teaching. Even supporters of detention say it is futile without proper communication between pupil and teacher. \"It shouldn't be about getting the kid to say sorry,\" says one London teacher. Basic conflict resolution techniques can help, she adds, \"where both sides get to reflect on the situation from the other's point of view\". Pupils need to think about how their behaviour can make teaching very difficult, while teachers could consider whether, in their drive to deliver the curriculum, they might be overlooking pupils' underlying learning difficulties, she says But others fear that in today's results-focused classrooms, \"teachers too often lack the time and the skills\" for this kind of approach.", "question": "It is late November , the summer holidays are ancient history , September resolutions about behaviour and homework are forgotten , everyone is tired , behaviour has @placeholder and detentions are hitting an end - of - term peak .", "option_0": "worsened", "option_1": "accomplished", "option_2": "blocks", "option_3": "slumped", "option_4": "revealed", "label": 3}

He drove from North Carolina to pursue bogus claims that the restaurant was the nexus of a child sex ring linked to Hillary Clinton's inner circle. No one was injured in what prosecutors described as an \"armed invasion\". Welch fired an assault rifle into a locked cabinet, believing that abused children were being kept there. Online conspiracy theorists had circulated a rumour that hacked emails from former Democratic presidential candidate's campaign manager contained clues to a paedophile ring. James Alefantis, who owns the restaurant, testified in court that Welch's \"physical terror\" had \"left lasting damage on the people I love\". He added that he hopes that \"one day in a more truthful time we will remember this day as an aberration\" when \"lies were seen as real and our social fabric had frayed\", the Washington Post reported. Welch, who has two young daughters, pleaded guilty in March to assault and firearms charges. In a letter to US District Judge Ketanji Jackson, Welch apologised for \"endangering the safety\" of the pizzeria customers, adding \"it was never my intention to harm or frighten innocent lives, but I realise now just how foolish and reckless my decision was\". Prosecutors had argued that a lengthy sentence was required to \"deter other people from pursuing vigilante justice based only on their YouTube feed\". \"Beyond Pizzagate, the internet is full of wild conspiracy theories where people urge members of the public... to take action,\" wrote the assistant US attorneys Demian Ahn and Sonali Patel.

{"article": "Analysis by BBC News shows the equivalent of £168 was spent on each child in order to hire in extra staff to cover vacancies and absences. Teachers unions say the amount of money spent reflects a \"serious teacher recruitment and retention crisis\". The government said the number of quality teachers was at a record high. The latest data for schools in England shows spending on supply teachers accounted for 6% of the total amount spent on teaching staff wages.  The overall figure spent on supply teachers fell by £18m on the previous year. Schools in London collectively spent the most on supply teachers. Primary and secondary schools in the capital spent £212m on extra staff, the equivalent of £260 per child. The Robert Clack School, in Dagenham, east London, spent the most on supply teachers in England. According to the government's data the school spent £953,807 on extra staff - the equivalent of £526 per child. Dr Neil Geach, the school's chair of governors, said the figures included expenditure on counselling staff, extra-curricular sport staff and professional development spending. \"The figures as reported do not reflect reality... We do not use unqualified staff or cover supervisors to cover teaching groups - our children's education is too important.\" Aside from London, Yorkshire and Humberside had the highest spending rate for supply staff of £161 per pupil, followed by schools in the West Midlands, which spent £160. Schools in the East of England spent the lowest amount per pupil - £137 for every child. Graham School in Scarborough, North Yorkshire spent £556,776 on supply teachers during the course of 2014-15, which was the highest amount in Yorkshire and Humberside. Two years ago, the school was in special measures owing to its poor performance and as a result the new head teacher Helen McEvoy said she had to replace 45% of the teachers who were working in the school. \"Yes we have spent on a lot on extra teachers but that reflects the successful journey we've been on coming out of special measures,\" she said. \"Our use of supply teachers reflects how in the past we've had a lot of vacant posts and that's because it can be hard to attract teachers to come and work in a remote part of the country.\" Government figures for 2014 show that teacher vacancy rate across England stood at 0.3%, which meant about 1,000 posts were vacant. Teachers unions have expressed concerns about the use of private supply teacher agencies, claiming that some firms are putting the pursuit of profit ahead of providing high quality teachers. The BBC found schools spent twice as much on buying in extra staff through private agencies than sourcing additional staff through local councils. 'Valuable role' Becca Morgan, who set up the supply agency Principal Teachers in Catterick 16 years ago, said her company was currently experiencing its busiest ever period. \"We start dealing with schools looking for supply teachers at 6.30 in the morning and I often stop answering calls at midnight. To put it bluntly without companies like mine the reality is that the education system would grind to a halt.\" Chris Keates, the general secretary of the union NASUWT, said the spend on supply staff reflected a \"serious teacher recruitment and retention crisis\". A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"Supply teachers provide a valuable role for schools, and schools themselves are best placed to make staffing decisions to reflect their individual needs. It is up to head teachers and governors to decide who is required for the job and this includes how best to cover absences. \"The number and quality of teachers is at a record high, with over 1,000 more graduates training to teach secondary subjects now than a year ago.

The main suspect in her disappearance, Robert Howard, died in prison last year. Kathleen Arkinson said she she felt police had missed opportunities to question some witnesses. She complained to the Police Ombudsman in 2006 about the police investigation, the inquest heard. She said police searched her house, breaking her door down with a sledgehammer, dug in her garden, and arrested her partner, adding \"insult to injury already caused by the lack of investigation\". Ms Arkinson also felt Howard's trial in 2005 for Arlene's murder was mishandled because the jury was unaware of his many convictions. She added that after Arlene went missing, false rumours grew worse. \"The rumours were that I killed Arlene,\" she said. \"The whole world was talking about it.\" Later, Ms Arkinson was questioned by counsel for the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who asked if it was the service's \"duty to investigate every opportunity to find out what happened\". \"It should have been,\" she replied, \"but they didn't do it.\" Ms Arkinson also said she became more protective of Arlene after an incident when Arlene was abused by a man in 1993. The man was jailed for that assault. Their mother had died three years earlier. Ms Arkinson told the inquest of the last time she saw Arlene when she left for a disco in Bundoran, and how she had given her an money to buy chips on the way home. She never saw her sister again. She described confronting Howard and a family, the Quinns, who she believed had taken Arlene to Bundoran, and that she had become convinced they were telling lies over her disappearance. Earlier, the mother of one of Arlene's friends told the inquest she became scared of Robert Howard after he told her he had killed a six-year-old girl. Bernadette Timoney, giving evidence via videolink, said in the years before Arlene went missing she thought Howard was \"an evil-looking man with drink in him\". \"I didn't like the look of him,\" she later said. \"I didn't want to be in his company - he was very scary.\" She added that she had daughters of her own and wanted to protect them. She also said that two months before she went missing, Arlene had told her she wanted Â£200 to go to England for an abortion and insisted her family should not know. She said Arlene became hysterical when she asked her if she had gone to get the money from a bank machine with Howard, or if Howard had done anything to her.

{"article": "They come to the Detroit Motor Show in droves, eager to get a peek at the latest offerings from the big three US car makers and the European manufacturers who are competing for market share in the lucrative car market. But car firms here, while continuing to focus on horsepower, are beginning to turn their attention to processing power. That's because most analysts agree that if car makers want to appeal to a younger generation, who are driving approximately 23% less than they used to, they'll need to shrink cars into, well, iPhones. \"If you look at the buying decisions of the younger generation, they're a little worried about the navigation system that gets you from point A to point B, but mainly they're interested in texting and being able to communicate with their friends,\" says Gary Silberg, the national automotive sector leader at consultancy KPMG. \"Whoever gets that right, that's who will win in the marketplace.\" Dieter Zetsche, the boss of Mercedes, put it more bluntly. \"The car of the future [is] a smartphone on wheels,\" he told the BBC. While only about 10% of cars are connected to the internet today, that number is expected to balloon to 90% by 2020, according to the consulting group Machina Research. The big question is who will be behind the software that connects cars - traditional car manufacturers like Mercedes and General Motors, or Silicon Valley giants like Apple and Google, who have turned their attention towards Detroit? Both tech firms have come out with in-car entertainment operating systems in the last year. \"There is a huge battle between the tech giants and auto firms right now,\" says Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT's) AgeLab and the associate director of the New England University Transportation Center. \"The question is: are you going to go to the dealer five years from now and have the choice of an Apple interface, an Android interface or a [traditional] manufacturer's interface?\" Special Report: Global Car Industry For now, most of the car firms, whose offerings are on display in Detroit, are playing it safe by keeping their options open - while keeping their ears to the ground about what's happening in Silicon Valley. Take Ford, for example. Mark Fields, the company's chief executive, told the BBC that the company was planning to open a Palo Alto office next week, to ensure that it remained close to Silicon Valley while considering its options. \"I think there are a lot of interested parties in what they call the fourth screen now - the screen within the vehicle,\" says Mr Fields. \"There are a lot of competitors that we recognised, a lot of competitors we didn't recognise, and there are probably a bunch of competitors that haven't been born yet that want a piece of the auto industry.\" Ford's strategy has been to continue to develop its software in house, while making sure that it is compatible with the latest tech offerings from elsewhere. It unveiled the latest version of its in-car entertainment software, Sync 3, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) last week, which featured upgrades like the ability to update the software wirelessly, as well as enabling it to interact with apps such as Spotify and AccuWeather. Notably, the company also switched from using Microsoft software to Blackberry's QNX operating system. Yet Don Butler, Ford's executive director of connected vehicle and services, said the company was still committed to remaining \"device agnostic\". \"Whether you've got a Blackberry, iPhone, or any of the various flavours of Android device, your phone will be compatible with the Sync system,\" says Mr Butler. The crucial challenge for everyone will be to keep up with changing technology. \"We're willing to toss out a smartphone every year or so but vehicles need to last 10 years,\" says MIT's Mr Reimer. \"No-one is going to have their iPhone 6 in their hands 20 years from now.\" This need to predict what consumers will want in five, 10 or 20 years is complicated by the fact the industry suffers from a data problem.

Do we really want to be able to update Facebook while on the go? Or would we settle for being able to sync our Pandora playlists while in traffic? And then of course there is the possibility that all of this might be made semi-irrelevant by the introduction of driverless car technology, which would free up our hands altogether. \"We're just at the beginning of a remarkable era where the car is going to change dramatically,\" says Guggenheim Partners senior managing partner John Casesa. \"And all of us are at the moment just trying to figure out how long it will take us to get there.\"", "question": "Detroit in January is largely @placeholder with just one group of people , petrolheads .", "option_0": "tasked", "option_1": "consumed", "option_2": "credited", "option_3": "decorated", "option_4": "filled", "label": 4}
{"article": "Researchers in London who have been carrying out preliminary tests of the fatty acid treatment, report their findings in Neuropharmacology journal. They came up with the idea because of a special diet used by some children with severe, drug resistant epilepsy to help manage their condition. The ketogenic diet is high in fat and low in carbohydrate. The high fat, low carbohydrate diet is thought to mimic aspects of starvation by forcing the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Although often effective, the diet has attracted criticism, as side-effects can be significant and potentially lead to constipation, hypoglycaemia, retarded growth and bone fractures. By pinpointing fatty acids in the ketogenic diet that are effective in controlling epilepsy, researchers hope they can develop a pill for children and adults that could provide similar epilepsy control without the side-effects. In early trials, the scientists, from Royal Holloway and University College London, say they have identified fatty acids that look like good candidates for the job. They found that not only did some of the fatty acids outperform a regular epilepsy medication called valproate in controlling seizures in animals, they also had fewer side-effects. Source: BBC Health Discover how to live safely with epilepsy What do I do if someone has a seizure? But many more tests are needed to determine if the treatment would be safe and effective in humans. Prof Matthew Walker, from the Institute of Neurology, University College London, said: \"Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide and approximately a third of these people have epilepsy that is not adequately controlled by our present treatments. \"This discovery offers a whole new approach to the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies in children and adults.\" Simon Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive at Epilepsy Action, said: \"We know the ketogenic diet can be a highly effective treatment for children with difficult to control epilepsy and it is starting to be used for adults. \"The diet is high in fats and low in carbohydrates and the balance of the diet needs to be carefully worked out for each child. Although some children manage the diet very well, others find the diet unpleasant and difficult to follow. Children can also experience side-effects including constipation and weight loss. \"The identification of these fatty acids is an exciting breakthrough. The research means that children and adults with epilepsy could potentially benefit from the science behind the ketogenic diet without dramatically altering their eating habits or experiencing unpleasant side-effects. \"We look forward to seeing how this research progresses.\"", "question": "A @placeholder made by the body when it uses fat as fuel could provide a new way of treating epilepsy , experts hope .", "option_0": "change", "option_1": "substance", "option_2": "lifetime", "option_3": "growing", "option_4": "choice", "label": 1}
{"article": "The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body which oversees the rules of the game, passed the law at a meeting in Zurich.

FA general secretary Alex Horne said: \"The idea is to get some consistency. The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed.\" From the time the new rule comes in to place, incidents such as Mario Balotelli's infamous \"Why Always Me?\" message, which he revealed after scoring against Manchester United in 2011, will be banned and subject to a sanction. Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said: \"It is definitely decided that players must not have any slogan or statement, and we are making the decision that it will apply to the World Cup.\" Law 4 of the game, which relates to players' equipment, will be amended. It states: \"Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer logo. \"A player/team of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturers' logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by Fifa.\" Meanwhile, the IFAB rejected a proposal from Uefa to amend the so-called \"triple punishment\" which occurs when a penalty kick is given within a game, warranting a player being sent off and a possible goal being scored. It was agreed that a pilot project carried out by the FA and Scottish Football Association relating to revolving substitutes in amateur football will continue, as will a Uefa experiment into the use of a sin bin in recreational football. The IFAB also discussed the potential use of video replays for match officials but remains of the view that technology should be allowed only for goal-line incidents because \"it is a clear yes or no decision\".

{"article": "The prime minister was asked how she could expect their support given the 1% cap on pay rises, leaving Theresa May battling to explain why such restraint was necessary. After all, in its manifesto, the Conservatives said that NHS spending was to increase. By the end of the Parliament, the Tories have promised that funding in England will be £8bn higher a year once inflation is taken into account. It does not set out how this will be paid for, although the party insists economic growth is key to spending more. However, as with all manifestos, you need to look at what is not being said as well as what is. The £8bn refers to only one part of the overall budget - the money allocated to front-line services. This accounts for just over three-quarters of the entire health budget. There was a lack of detail about much of the rest of the pot, which goes on things like staff training and public health programmes such as stopping smoking, apart from the promise of extra investment in buildings. During the last Parliament these pots were cut to help pump more money into the front-line services. The same could happen again - albeit with some protection this time for the buildings budget. What is also not obvious is that the £8bn is much less than the health service has been used to. Before 2010, the NHS had been getting an extra 4% a year over its history. This reflects the fact that the health service faces rising costs from factors such as the ageing population, the cost of new drugs and lifestyle issues like obesity. But those rises dried up between 2010 and 2017. Since then the NHS has been getting about 1% a year. What difference will the £8bn for the next Parliament make to that trend? Very little. Forecasts suggest the spending plans amount to just over 1%. But the Tories are not alone on this. The Nuffield Trust think tank has been looking at the spending plans set out by all three main parties - and concluded there is very little between them. And all three fall well short of the 4% average. It explains why, despite the promises of extra money, the Tories have felt it necessary to continue with the pay cap. It's not in the manifesto - instead that talks about \"benefits\" such as flexible working and new support for staff with mental health problems - but it remains very much a part of their wider NHS policy. Following the last election, the then chancellor George Osborne announced public sector pay was to be capped at 1% until 2019.

But post-Olympics she found herself struggling financially and looking for work. Dozens of the 553 athletes who represented Team GB in London are job-hunting. At least 64 have quit their sports for a variety of reasons, while a further 24 are undecided about their futures, according to research conducted by BBC Sport. For Laybourne, whose side beat Algeria at the Games but lost four other matches and subsequently £3.1m of funding, a career in sports education beckoned. Source: BBC Sport \"The sense of pride, the satisfaction has been worth it without a doubt,\" Laybourne told BBC Sport of her London 2012 experience. \"But I have to be able to put a roof over my head, to support myself and potentially a family in the future.\" Retirements are par for the course for top athletes, whether they are brought on by unexpected injury, a cut in funding, or simply the natural end to a competitive career. The British Olympic Association (BOA) recently hosted an inaugural Athletes Career Fair at the Madejski Stadium in Reading. The hunt for work continues for many who formed part of Britain's most successful Olympic team. In the broader economic climate 2.49 million are unemployed. In Reading, 150 Paralympians and Olympians met more than 40 exhibitors. For many attendees, the months immediately after retirement were proving as challenging as anything faced on the track. \"There's a natural grieving process,\" admits former modern pentathlete Georgina Harland. \"It's a very difficult time.\" Harland, a bronze medal winner at Athens in 2004, retired from her sport in 2008 after sustaining a calf injury two months before the Beijing Olympics. At 30, she immediately knew her competitive career had ended. \"I was very well supported by my sport in terms of my transition period, but it was not easy to go through,\" she said. \"You have had this one goal for so long and never questioned it. Then suddenly it's not there anymore.\" The two-time European champion and former world number one found herself unexpectedly searching for some form of paid employment. \"You are used to aspiring to be, literally, the best in the world,\" she said. Media playback is not supported on this device \"But you have to make compromises. What is success in the normal workplace and what does success mean to me?\" Harland experimented with jobs away from sport, but quickly realised she wanted her future to have some form of sporting connection. Now she finds herself employed by the BOA as a sport engagement manager, responsible for the team that organised the career fair in Reading. \"I am an ex-athlete and went through this process myself,\" she explained. \"At the fair, we had the British Olympic Association, the British Paralympic Association, the Institute for Sport, UK Sport and the Dame Kelly Holmes Legacy Trust. We all recognise that there is that responsibility to ensure that athletes are supported during what is a very difficult time.\" England and Great Britain hockey captain Kate Walsh knows all about that difficult time. In 2007, her sport's funding was cut. Then, after London 2012, a gap in funding provision meant almost her entire squad has had to look for paid work elsewhere. \"We all had to go out and get jobs,\" she said. \"That took some time. \"It's really scary for some athletes, devastating.

She does not intend to retire from her sport yet - and has found part-time work in public relations for a firm in Berkshire.

That's far less ideal than doing your training and being able to recover properly.\" Harland is sympathetic to the plights of those out-of-work ex-athletes. \"Don't panic\" is her advice. \"There is time to make mistakes in terms of finding the right path now.

A Chester Crown Court jury unanimously cleared the couple, from East Sussex. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the couple had been subject to a \"thorough and ethical investigation\". The couple had spent more than two-and-a-half years on bail since being arrested in August 2013 under the NCA's Operation Pallial. It was claimed Mr Jones, 66, took one boy into an office and threw chairs at him while encouraged by Mrs Jones, 63. The couple said the main allegation against them related to 1973 and 1974 when the accuser was aged nine or 10, but during the nine-day trial, jurors heard they did not start working in north Wales until 1975. \"We spent two-and-a-half years of not being able to clear our names and not being able to talk about it,\" said Mrs Jones, who was chief executive of Southdown Housing Association, based in Lewes at the time of her arrest. \"On alleged victims' sites on Facebook and Twitter, people seem to feel they can talk about anything even if it's not factual or just. That was quite distressing.\" Mrs Jones was awarded an OBE in 2014 for her services to people with learning disabilities.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device This South Africa team is the poorest we've seen in a long, long time but England still needed to put them away. England hadn't beaten them in 10 years, the weather wasn't ideal and they hadn't played since completing a whitewash over Australia in June, so Saturday's 37-21 victory at Twickenham was a good result. One of the biggest changes since Jones took over last November is the England players' fitness levels. Jones has bags of experience and is speaking to players straight. And one of the things he will have told them is that they won't be great players unless they get fitter. So the players have listened and got fitter. There's a great story about Ben Youngs: the Leicester scrum-half was considered to be overweight, so Jones kept showing him bags of sweets. If you don't get the message after that, you never will. Man of the match Youngs looked sharp against the Springboks. I don't know what Pieter-Steph du Toit's sight is like out of his right eye, because Youngs left him for dead twice with dummies, but Youngs spotted the opportunity and England had support runners on his shoulder both times to finish things off. Billy Vunipola has also been released as a result of improved fitness, while Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes and Chris Robshaw were workaholics. Jones is clever psychologically. During the Six Nations, he kept talking about Robshaw and James Haskell. After Saturday's match, the first person he mentioned was Robshaw. The two back-rows are elder statesmen and he's telling everyone that they're his best players. That's no coincidence. It's a message to the rest of the squad: come and knock these guys off. Jonny May's try was beautifully crafted and executed, a genuine team try. The art of attack is fixing defenders, using dummy runners as smoke and mirrors, getting the ball in behind and finishing things off. At any time that move could have fallen down because of a poor decision or poor execution, but it didn't. The summer tour of Australia went great but they conceded more tries than they scored, which would have been a concern. Jones brought in a specialist defence coach, Jason Ryles, from rugby league outfit Melbourne Storm, and for a lot of the game against South Africa the defence worked reasonably well. There was a drop-off in intensity but that's to be expected given the gap between matches. The intensity will increase in the coming weeks. I like the fact Jones never seems to be happy and keeps saying he wants England to be number one in the world. It won't be easy, and staying number one will be even more difficult than getting there in the first place. But there aren't many positions - the flankers, inside centre, both wings? - that aren't competitive and this is a very good England team in the making. Media playback is not supported on this device To say South African rugby is in crisis is an exaggeration. But they are certainly not in a good situation, given their past status. When players started leaving South Africa, they were often vastly experienced and could adjust well to playing club rugby abroad and returning home for internationals. But bit by bit, those players - people like Bakkies Botha, Victor Matfield, Jannie du Plessis, Schalk Burger, Francois Steyn - have either drifted away, retired or their form has dropped, and nobody has stepped up to replace them. Injuries have hurt them - they've had a host in the back row, including to Francois Louw and Duane Vermuelen - and they've not had a steady half-back partnership for the last few years. You're always going to struggle for stability and consistency if you don't have that. Media playback is not supported on this device You've got to feel for Scotland - they will be hurting. Again. The win over Australia was theirs and the celebrations were on ice. But it all melted away in slightly unspectacular fashion. Australia were down to 14 men, with Will Skelton in the sin-bin, but Scotland didn't play the percentages and the territory as they should have. As a result, Tevita Kuridrani ended up blasting through a couple of tackles - poor old Peter Horne is not going to be able to watch that replay - and scoring under the posts. But Scotland did play some decent rugby. The Gray brothers, Jonny and Richie, were everywhere, between them they made 40-odd tackles and didn't miss one. And Jonny Gray in particular never seemed to be without the ball in his hands. Glasgow fly-half Finn Russell is young and fearless and has some nice, deft touches. The fact that he's already got 20 caps to his name and is only 24 is good for the team. Outside him, Huw Jones' first try showed great speed and change of direction, while the second showed how explosive he can be in a tight, confined space. I'm looking forward to seeing more of him. Vern Cotter's side are waiting to click, and a victory over Australia might just have released them. It certainly would have locked away a few ghosts, following on from their last-gasp defeat by the Wallabies at last year's World Cup. Scotland should expect to beat Argentina next week, despite the Pumas being ranked three places above them in sixth. They should certainly embrace the pressure of playing at home and not be afraid to expect to win. Argentina will want to make it fast, loose and scary and put the likes of Joaquin Tuculet and Santiago Cordero in space. But Scotland will beat them with a more structured game. Media playback is not supported on this device After last week's poor display against Australia, it was just important for Wales to get a victory against Argentina. It wasn't a performance that made you go \"wow\" but the northern hemisphere sides are just getting back into the swing of things. Argentina are a very good side with some classy, quality players, so Wales were never comfortable and never able to get away from them. But the return of Alun Wyn Jones and Sam Warburton helped keep them cool under pressure. I liked the performance of Ross Moriarty at number eight. The Gloucester man is like a mini-explosion in a collision, whether he's carrying or putting in a tackle. Not many players manage to be that aggressive and maintain control. And if you're not winning collisions, you're going to be on the back foot. Liam Williams was a real livewire on the wing but he needs to get the ball into his hands more often. I'd like to see him play at full-back, because at least then he'd be behind the play, able to see what was happening and get involved, rather than waiting out on the wing for the ball to come to him. Wales are trying to build on what they started 18 months ago, which is using more dummy runners, putting the ball in behind, and looking for space either within that diamond shape or out wide. In the build-up to Williams' try, they got it spot on and Dan Biggar ended up bursting through a gap - and it's not often you hear anyone say that. Most sides can't do it because their fitness doesn't allow them to, but if you can execute it, it's pretty much impossible to stop you. Argentina play a very similar game to New Zealand, except they don't have as many world-class players. So they are going to make more mistakes, which will allow opposition teams to take advantage. When it sticks it's magnificent to watch; when it doesn't it looks as if they don't really know what they're doing. But in Martin Landajo and Nicolas Sanchez they have a formidable half-back partnership and because of the way they play, they were never out of the game. A second-string Ireland side did what they were expected to do against Canada. But it was nice to see Joey Carberry and Gary Ringrose showing what they can do. The Leinster fly-half and centre respectively have great poise and understanding of the game and could be challenging for first-team places soon. When Joe Schmidt took over as head coach in 2013, everyone was taken aback by the impact he had on Irish rugby. They won two Six Nations titles in a row but then big players retired and other teams seemed to have worked them out. Media playback is not supported on this device But Schmidt seems to have rejigged things, Ireland won in Cape Town in the summer and the performance in beating the All Blacks last week was incredible. New Zealand hadn't lost in 18 games and not in 111 years against Ireland. But Ireland showed you can beat them playing a controlled, structured game. You have to be phenomenally fit to implement that game plan and execute perfectly 99% of what you do, and even then New Zealand might only need that 1% to beat you. When it was loose and frenetic in Chicago, the All Blacks ruled the roost. There was a period of New Zealand dominance that stemmed from Sexton kicking the ball out on the full. Ireland struggled to get their foot back on the throat of the snake that was trying to bite them for about 15 minutes and became inhibited. I thought that maybe Ireland were gone, but they didn't freeze for long, maybe because they have been in the same situation in recent years and knew what they had to do. But a repeat result in Dublin would be even better than their first, because it's not as if New Zealand have suddenly fallen off a cliff.", "question": "Every coach has high standards but I think England boss Eddie Jones ' standards are higher than almost anybody 's .

{"article": "On the economic front, he's got some work to do. It's not that the US economy is in such bad shape. It's recovered better than the UK one. The problem is more that he has portrayed it as being wrecked, and he has raised expectations of doubling the growth rate to 4%, while \"bringing millions of jobs back to America\". \"We're going to win so much. You're going to get sick and tired of winning. You're gonna be saying, Mr President, enough with the winning.\" The Texans talk about blowhards as being \"all hat, but no cattle\". Well, Donald Trump has certainly done the hat bit. So now... ? The economic plan is threadbare, and it's not clear who is going to be driving it in the Trump administration. Over at the US Fed, it could get a bit wobbly, as the president-elect is not a big fan of Janet Yellen or her management of monetary policy, and he may want her replaced. The key elements are a big push on infrastructure, particularly in transport: \"Believe me, it'll be second to none.\" Good news for the construction sector. Market pundits are also talking up healthcare stocks, as Trump and his Republican allies set about dismantling Obamacare. There are profits to be made out of the wreckage there. You might also buy shares in the coal-mining industry, which has been tanking of late, and it's collapsed almost entirely on this side of the Pond. Targeting votes in rustbelt and mining states such as West Virginia, Candidate Trump went big on the prospects for reviving coal production. Yes, it's dirty, but the president-elect believes climate change is \"a hoax\" perpetrated by the Chinese. So that could upend a lot of the growing green economy in the US. And if eight years of Obama's climate change policy is to be thrown into reverse, repudiation of the commitments made to international limits on carbon emissions could entice signatories into doing the same. But the bit that gives the markets the jitters is trade. It's been the signature element of his populist pitch - that the governing elite have signed up to trade deals that have neglected the interests of Ordinary Joe. The signs have been there for a long time, but they are clearest in the stagnation of real earnings since the 1970s, and the reduced share of the economic pie that's gone to wages. The Trump Movement has, as its foundation, the giant shift in manufacturing and economic power, particularly to Asia. And there are clear parallels there with the de-industrialisation and hollowing out of much of the north of England, which led to the vote for Brexit. So the big question is what he is going to do about trade? Repudiating deals? Tearing them up? Imposing punitive tariffs in economic warfare? Or seeking to re-negotiate, with a mandate from the American people and the one trademark skill that he brings to the White House - deal-making. The UK will be looking for a post-Brexit deal with the US. Trump has sounded more positive about that than others in Washington. But what kind of deal would it be? The basis for international trading is that all sides win. The catch is that it can require painful adjustment within countries. Donald Trump doesn't like that adjustment, so the rhetoric points to a trade deal that is strongly favourable to Americans over its trading partners. Also worth watching in his economic policy is the approach to taxation and spending. He has said he wants to lower tax on high earners and to simplify federal tax bands to three levels: 12%, 25% and 33%. He also wants to cut headline corporation tax from 35% to 15%. That's not much below the level at which the UK Treasury has been aiming, and it's higher than Ireland's corporation tax rate. That could stimulate growth. But tax experts in Washington think, with the promises on infrastructure and defence spending, that it will instead make the federal debt balloon, by perhaps more than $5 trillion. That helps explain why the mighty US dollar is not in its customary role, acting as the safe haven for investors. The Japanese yen and the Swiss franc look more solid now. But it raises the question of how much of this plan President Trump can get through Congress. He may be a Republican, but he's far from sharing the fiscal conservatism of his party's representatives on the Hill.  Given their differences and Trump's mandate having been achieved without them, that relationship is going to take a lot of managing. What will also require managing is the Trump business portfolio. Unlike other presidents and prime ministers, he does not intend to put it into a blind trust. How could he, when the Trump brand is so prominent on his property and business interests? So his family will continue to manage it. And as he's proven already to be a rather divisive character, they may have their work cut out to secure these Trump assets. From the bling and buildings in the US to his golf courses north of Aberdeen and at Turnberry in Ayrshire, these are now extensions of the presidential brand. The Commander-in-Chief will surely want them to be protected as such.", "question": "It 's hard to know where to start with the @placeholder that is president - elect Donald J Trump .

Tui is also worried about the effect of migrants on its Greek business. Since the attack in Tunisia, the Foreign Office now advises against all but essential travel to the country. \"This is the most tragic event and loss of human life that I have ever had to deal with or my company and we remain deeply shocked in terms of the loss of life, those customers that were injured and all the trauma that our customers had to go through, through these terrible events,\" Tui Group chief executive Peter Long told the BBC. \"We were 100% focused on making sure that our customers were looked after and that was our number one priority.\" He also said that the company was reliant on Foreign Office advice on when to resume offering holidays in Tunisia. The company said that in the three months to the end of June the attack had caused repatriation and cancellation costs of about €10m ($11m; £7m). Tui also said it had been hit by the continued economic turmoil in Greece, which made withdrawing cash from banks more difficult. Mr Long said he thought it was time for other European governments to help Greece deal with migrants arriving at Greek islands, especially from Syria. \"We know that tourism for Greece is so important, their economy is fragile and what we don't want to see [is] a deteriorating demand from our customers going to the Greek islands.\" However, Tui said that business had been resilient and that summer bookings were still ahead of last year's level.

More than 650,000 people are employed in the holiday sector and more than 22 million people travel to Greece every year from around the world. In its third quarter results, Tui said that the economic turmoil of the debt crisis had affected demand for Greek holidays, especially from Germany.  A developing issue around immigration could pose a fresh threat to the sector. \"I worry about the publicity putting people off going to the Greek islands,\" Mr Long said. \"Therefore I hope the Greeks are able to process [the migrants] and I'm sure other European governments will look at ways of helping them through this difficult situation with so many migrants arriving at the same time.\" Read more of Kamal's blog", "question": "Travel operator Tui Group has announced how much its business will be affected by the @placeholder attack in Tunisia in June .", "option_0": "beach", "option_1": "following", "option_2": "bomb", "option_3": "drone", "option_4": "terror", "label": 0}

Behind closed doors, the 1,510 members will nominate the next president, the prime minister, and most importantly, the party's general secretary.

On Thursday, top leaders gave brief speeches emphasising the need to build Vietnam's economic prosperity, and also reviewed the leadership of the central committee, reported Viet Nam News. Nga Pham, BBC Vietnamese: 'Rumours and speculation' As most important meetings of the top echelon of the party are conducted behind closed doors and little information is ever made public, it is inevitable that rumours spread widely ahead of any congress. But Vietnam has never seen the level of speculation circulating this time. Right up to the opening day of the congress there are still divided opinions about who is going to become the party's general secretary on 28 January.

{"article": "Leslee Udwin denies claims that she broke a contract with the prison by airing the interview with the rapist, convicted over the 2012 Delhi bus rape. She said India's legal actions, including a request for a global ban, had no legal or practical basis. The film has been banned in India, but the BBC showed it in the UK. In the interview, rapist Mukesh Singh, who is facing the death penalty, shows no remorse. The 23-year-old student, who died days after the attack in December 2012, was repeatedly beaten and gang-raped while being driven around Delhi in a bus. In the interview, Singh suggested she might have survived if she had not fought back. Earlier in the week a Delhi court issued an injunction against the film after police argued the interview contained offensive remarks towards women, and could cause a public outcry. Home Minister Rajnath Singh has since promised an inquiry into how access was gained to the prison, and threatened unspecified action against the BBC for airing the film. Tihar Jail, which allowed the interview, has alleged that Udwin broke an agreement by not allowing officials to vet her footage. But Udwin has insisted that she followed all the correct procedures. \"I wrote an impassioned letter to the director general of prisons. She granted her in principle permission,\" Udwin told the BBC. \"The Ministry of Home Affairs then granted a written signed permission. I got a signed permission from the convict in this case and a permission signed by the prison.\" Udwin earlier told a news conference she had given the prison all 16 hours of footage from her interview, but officials watched only three hours before telling her there was too much material. She then submitted a shorter version, which was approved. She added that she was confident the decision to ban the film would be overturned in Delhi's High Court. The documentary, India's Daughter, was due to be shown on the BBC and NDTV on Sunday. While NDTV has been forced to shelve its broadcast, the BBC changed its schedules and aired the documentary on Wednesday night. The director general of Tihar Jail said officials had issued a \"legal notice\" to the BBC on Wednesday requesting that it did not show the film, even in the UK. The notice apparently came from Rakesh Singh, an official in the ministry of information. The BBC's director of television, Danny Cohen, replied to Mr Singh, saying: \"We do not feel the film as currently edited could ever be construed as derogatory to women or an affront to their dignity. \"Indeed, it highlights the challenges women in India face today.\" He added: \"We are not planning to transmit the film in any territory which lies under Indian legal jurisdiction.\" Some activists have criticised the film and accused the film-maker of giving a platform to the rapist. But the father of the victim described the film as \"the bitter truth\" and said everyone should watch it. \"If a man can speak like that in jail, imagine what he would say if he was walking free,\" he told NDTV.", "question": "A British film - maker has defended an interview with a convicted Indian rapist , hours after authorities there launched a slew of legal @placeholder .", "option_0": "action", "option_1": "measures", "option_2": "events", "option_3": "competitions", "option_4": "threats", "label": 1}

Mat Whitecross will direct, having previously made the Stone Roses' film Spike Island - a fictional story about a wannabe rock band who tried to get their demo tape into the hands of their idols at their seminal outdoor show near Widnes. He also won acclaim for Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll, his whimsical, mischievous biopic of punk pioneer Ian Dury, with a head-turning central performance by Andy Serkis.

A year later their debut album, Definitely Maybe topped the charts  - but the Gallagher brothers' fractious relationship was already a story. In September 1994, Noel walked out of the band after Liam made offensive remarks about American audiences, hitting him over the head with a tambourine during a Los Angeles gig. They reconciled to record the career-defining album (What's The Story) Morning Glory and, by 1996, were able to play two sold-out gigs at Knebworth, watched by 250,000 fans. Over the next decade, the band scored eight UK number one singles, 15 NME Awards, five Brit Awards, nine Q Awards and four MTV Europe Music Awards. But there was a constant backdrop of squabbles and in-fighting.

{"article": "The highest rise of £65 in Somerset is partly due to a one-year interim levy for flood defence work. North Somerset's council tax is likely to go up by £53 for a Band D property after a freeze for the past few years. Deputy leader, Elfan Ap Rees said: \"I'm disappointed the government hasn't really been listening to all of the councils all of the time.\" The expected rises are: Gloucestershire £53; Bristol £60; South Gloucestershire £60; Wiltshire £52; Swindon £49 and Bath and North East Somerset £42. They all take into account police and fire services which are also expected to put up their share of the council tax bill. For the county council areas, there may also be further increases added in to the council tax bill from the town and parish councils precepts. West Somerset Council merged its services with neighbouring Taunton Deane to cut down on expenditure in 2013. West Somerset's Conservative leader, Anthony Trollope-Bellew said: \"Our projections are we will not be able to produced a balanced budget in 2018-19. \"How are we going to deal with that? Well we are starting to try and deal with it now, we've got two years to try to sort it out.\" The councils will be setting their budgets in February and March, ahead of the new financial year. Once the budget is set, the council tax rises will be confirmed. BBC Points West Political editor, Paul Barltrop: We're all going to pay more and get less for years to come. That is the picture emerging from our councils as they grapple with further reductions in the funding they get from central government. It has been falling for years, but the obvious savings - like being more efficient and having fewer offices and staff - have been made. So there is quiet relief in many corners of the West that the government's had a change of heart, and is pretty much expecting councils to put up tax. That may not go down well with residents, but they may have to get used to it. The expectation is that putting up tax by around a pound a week will be the norm in the next few years. Not that it will make life easy for our councillors.

{"article": "The same can hardly be said for the surrounding area. It has the usual transport terminal trappings: rundown hotels, greasy fast-food joints and taxis whose meters may or may not correctly reflect the tariff. Behind the station there is a railway yard with graffiti-daubed, rotting rolling stock obstructing access to the Sava riverfront, just a matter of metres away. But all this is set to change. A massive hoarding on the front of the station depicts a future which seems to have beamed in from a parallel universe - or, at the very least, a different country. It features a gleaming tower surrounded by shops and parks on the banks of the river. And underneath, the logo and contact details for the Belgrade Waterfront development. \"Belgrade Waterfront is a project for which the city has waited for more than 50 years,\" says Milutin Folic, the head of Belgrade's city planning department. \"After the Second World War, we had plans to relocate the train and bus stations and free the important and central area of brownfield for the city to expand towards the rivers. With Belgrade Waterfront, a city which sits on two rivers will finally reach the water. \"It will bring urban ideas to daylight, put the construction industry back on its feet - and we hope other parts of the economy will see the benefits.\" The entire project is worth more than â‚¬3bn (Â£2.3bn; $3.4bn) - and could take 30 years to complete. By its end, Belgrade should have a new opera house, shopping centre and luxury hotels and apartments. There should also be much-improved access to the riverfront, currently a glaringly underused resource. But support for Belgrade Waterfront is far from universal. Initially, reservations focused on the recent revival of the riverfront Savamala district, which overlaps the area under development. It has become a cultural hub, with galleries, arts centres and nightlife attracting crowds of overseas and local visitors. Its supporters fear that some or all of this might be lost in the fervour to revamp the city. Then there were concerns over the bidding process - or rather, the lack of one. The government and city authorities simply appointed Eagle Hills, a developer based in Abu Dhabi, the source of the funding for the project. Opponents say it is far from clear how Belgrade Waterfront's costs will be met. \"The government said there would be no tender because 'we have the best investor already'. They just announced it would be done this way and covered it by changing the laws where necessary or just ignoring them where they couldn't change them,\" says Luka Knezevic Strika, a visual artist who opposes Belgrade Waterfront. \"I don't mind cleaning up the trash - but not when the price is giving away the land where the trash stood. Making expensive housing doesn't have any benefit to the citizens. Leaving it as it was would have been better - we would have been richer for a future when we could have developed it as we wanted.\" This partly explains why a crowd of thousands is spending the early part of their Saturday evening gathering in front of Belgrade City Hall, blowing whistles and waving flags emblazoned with a cartoon of a yellow rubber duck. \"The word duck in Serbian means fraud,\" explains Luka Knezevic Strika. \"It's a symbolic way of saying the project is really Belgrade Water-fraud.\" But it is not just the lack of transparency that concerns the campaigners. They were formerly a small but determined group who called themselves Ne Davimo Beograd (\"Don't Drown Belgrade\"), but their numbers have swollen since a bizarre and disturbing incident at the end of April. Just hours after polls closed in the general election, masked men armed with baseball bats enforced the overnight demolition of several Savamala buildings that stood in the way of Belgrade Waterfront. Thousands of outraged citizens joined the Ne Davimo Beograd campaigners in a series of protests before Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic admitted, at the start of June, that city officials were behind the episode. \"I'm afraid for the system when events like this happen,\" says Knezevic Strika. \"There can't be good intentions behind something that turns out to be government-sponsored terrorism.\" The incident has also overshadowed Belgrade's dire need for economic stimulus and infrastructure development. This city of two million has long been one of the largest, most important and vibrant in south-east Europe. But the past 25 years have not been kind. The violent disintegration of Yugoslavia brought an international embargo and hyperinflation, as well as Nato bombs. Then just as newly independent Serbia was emerging from the literal and metaphorical rubble, the European financial crisis hit it particularly hard. James Thornley, senior partner at the Belgrade office of auditors KPMG, says there is a good business case for a development like Belgrade Waterfront. \"Everything stopped on commercial development 10 years ago, and now there's a shortage. If a major investor came to us and asked where they could locate 500 or 1,000 people, we would struggle to advise them. \"There really is potentially a demand for what's being offered - opportunities for the place to be a hub where people can live and work have to be a positive thing.\" Some changes are already apparent. Riverfront renovations have produced a promenade with playgrounds, a beach volleyball court, and food and drink outlets. It is already well used by a mix of families, cyclists and cocktail drinkers. Meanwhile, construction of the Belgrade Tower and the high-end W Hotel can be seen through transparent windows on nearby hoardings. Belgrade's planning chief, Milutin Folic, sees it as a clear improvement for citizens. \"The balance is so far in favour of the project - it really changes the area in a positive direction. It's not like we're destroying an historical area and building something new. We're actually not destroying anything - we're turning brownfield into an urban area,\" he says. While the new riverside leisure area already seems a popular success, the protests are likely to continue. People in Serbia have learned to be deeply suspicious - after decades of dodgy sell-offs and promises that all too frequently have come to nothing. At the very least, Belgrade Waterfront now needs to do a lot of bridge-building to show it is not going to fall into that category as well.

There are now 16 players on the deals which see the Welsh Rugby Union pay 60% of their wages. The contracts also give the governing body greater control over the players, and can limit the number of games they play. Warburton is one of only two Blues on the joint deals with utility back Gareth Anscombe the other. Blues wing Alex Cuthbert turned down an offer of a contract during the 2014-15 campaign, according to Wales coach Warren Gatland, prompting speculation about his long-term future. Fly-half Rhys Patchell is also being linked with a move away from Blues. Warburton insists his heart is with the city of his upbringing and where he used to watch Wales and Cardiff predecessors Martyn Williams and Robin Sowden-Taylor play. \"I remember watching Dan Baugh playing when I was really young,\" said Warburton before Saturday's 35-30 Pro12 defeat by Glasgow. \"I didn't really know many players then and I remember seeing this guy with his collars tucked in and his socks down, just taking people's heads off and I was like 'I want to do that.

Liberty said it hoped to re-employ some ex-Tata employees who lost their jobs when the plants were mothballed by Tata last October. However, applications are also being encouraged from those looking to join the steel industry for the first time. Liberty said it planned to offer apprenticeship opportunities, including modern apprenticeships in engineering, finance and commercial planning.

He added that there was anecdotal evidence suggesting the weaker pound encouraged overseas visitors to spend. Sales of watches and jewellery were up 16.6% in July compared with the same month last year - the biggest jump in nearly two years. Compared with June, UK retail sales were up 1.4%, a figure that was much stronger than expected. Sterling climbed almost a cent against the dollar after publication of the figures. The retail data went against expectations of an immediate hit to consumer confidence from the UK's vote to leave the European Union. Other figures released earlier this week also showed little immediate impact of the Brexit vote on the labour market, but there were signs of inflation pressures building after the plunge in sterling, which could diminish the spending power of households. Dennis de Jong of UFX.com said: \"The High Street certainly hasn't taken as big a hit as many had predicted in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, but retailers will still have concerns about what lies ahead over the next few months. \"The government won't be celebrating just yet, as they will need to see more evidence that consumers are continuing to reach for their wallets as the effects of Brexit become clearer.\" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics said that \"consumers' blissful ignorance won't last long\". \"July's retail sales figures show that consumers have been protected from the immediate fallout of the Brexit vote, but with firms intending to stop hiring and inflation set to soar, the High Street is set for a tough year,\" he said. \"The real test for consumer spending lies in 2017 when jobs cuts will kick in and inflation will erode spending power,\" Mr Tombs added. The Bank of England more than halved its forecasts for household spending growth over the next two years after the vote to leave the EU.

Rovers finally levelled after 56 minutes when Marquis deftly side-footed home from 12 yards.

When the build is completed in May it will house a kitchen and additional living space in an open plan format. Yet, surveying the spick and span surroundings, James doesn't look happy. \"It's a bit of a mess,\" he frowns. James is a stickler for tidiness. But there's a very practical reason behind his insistence on perfection. \"I'm registered blind, it's a condition called retinitis pigmentosa,\" he says. \"I basically have 10% sight but with no peripheral vision. \"It's like looking through a letterbox or a viewfinder in a camera. Because my sight is so poor there can't be anything lying around for me to trip over.\" James, 48, has worked in construction since he was 18. He first noticed a problem with his sight in his early 20s. \"I tried to get on with my job on a building site, but my eyes kept getting worse. At night I couldn't see at all. \"I tried to ignore it but it started to impact on my work. When I was on sites as part of a team, we were paid by how many bricks we laid and I was getting slower and slower because I couldn't see properly. It was hampering my colleagues.\" He was forced to rethink his direction within the industry and in the end he managed to turn a negative into a positive. \"Because my sight was so bad, my organisation had to be good. I thought ahead, tried to anticipate problems.\" James made the transition from hands-on building to project managing, eventually starting his own firm, contracting out construction workers to other jobs. Then in 2007, came his Eureka moment. \"I was sitting at home in my conservatory, shivering. It was expensive but inefficient. In the winter it was freezing and in the summer, when the sun hit the windows it was like having a magnifying glass on the back of the house. \"I thought I could do better and that's where the idea for my business came in. I designed a conservatory with no thermal break - it's not a separate space and is integrated into the house which allows it to retain heat.\" Unlike a traditional conservatory which has a glass roof and walls, his garden rooms have a solid roof and walls. He adds: \"We use specially made glass with a gas field and it's often triple glazed.\" The builds aren't cheap, starting at around £40,000 and going up to more than £100,000 for bespoke versions. Most customers come to James because they either want to stay in their current properties or cannot afford to move somewhere bigger. And this kind of market is expanding. In 2014 the company expects to turn over £500,000, doubling in 2015 and again in 2016. As the business has grown and James's sight has deteriorated, he's had to constantly adapt the way he works. Since 2013, he has employed an old friend Paul Allen to act as \"his eyes\" on site. \"I drive James to sites, help him check over work, pick up building materials from the merchants and so on,\" says Paul. \"If a ladder hasn't been propped up properly, or if there's scaffolding around, I need to warn him. \"If he goes off sick we're all in trouble!\" Paul also supports James in ways not related to his sight: \"We trust each other and he bounces ideas off me for a second opinion.\" In the next couple of years James wants to expand the business but is not going down the conventional banking route. Instead he's using existing capital in the business, as well as £50,000 he was awarded for winning the 2013 Stelios Award for Disabled Entrepreneurs. Yet James says he prefers to describe himself in another way. \"I think of myself as a para-entrepreneur - different rather than disabled. When you're in London, the chap standing on the tallest column in Trafalgar Square has got one arm and one eye but we don't ever think of Lord Nelson as being disabled, he's just Lord Nelson.\" In 2012 one of the company's projects was shortlisted for the International Design and Architecture Awards. The competition was open to entrants from across the industry and did not take into account James's sight problems. And James believes that when customers are parting with thousands of pounds, they're not going to take into account the fact that he's got a disability. \"We're selling our product in the mainstream and asking customers to spend their taxed income. They don't get a grant for buying from us,\" he says. \"Customers don't care whether I have a disability or not, as long as we get the job done.\" For more on this story, listen to On the Money on BBC Radio 5 live on Sunday, 23 March at 19:30 GMT, or catch up on the BBC iPlayer.", "question": "An expanse of smooth concrete , neatly @placeholder bricks and barely a speck of dust in sight - this is not your average building site .", "option_0": "finds", "option_1": "embodied", "option_2": "trimmed", "option_3": "piled", "option_4": "spaced", "label": 3}

Her mother contributed to the appeal which was broadcast on Monday night. Police said some calls to the programme related to the identity of a hooded man seen near Caroline before she died. Others were said to have offered information to the general inquiry. The Crimewatch appeal was led by Det Supt Jim Kerr in a bid to generate fresh leads. He said: \"We have received a positive response following last night's appeal on the Crimewatch programme. \"More than 20 calls were received and the information given to police will now be followed up by the officers from the Homicide Governance and Review Team and I am hopeful that some calls could assist with the investigation.\" Video contributions were made by Caroline's mother Margaret McKeich and the schoolgirl's friend Joanne Menzies, who was one of the last people to have seen her alive. Mrs McKeich, 60, told the programme that she believed locals knew who was responsible for her daughter's death.

Cameroon, who have won this title once before, will be hoping the winning spirit from their senior team rubs off the junior Indomitable Lions. Zambia is banking on home ground advantage to run away with the trophy but they will have to combat formidable opposition in the form of Egypt, Guinea and Mali. Having not played in qualifiers as hosting granted them automatic qualification, the junior Chipolopolo may not know how prepared they are for competitive action. However, they did play some friendly matches in Spain - against B sides for Tenerife, FC Basel and Barcelona - winning the first two matches 1-0 with the final one ending in a 3-1 defeat. The host nation wound up its practice matches with a 2-1 win over regional rivals South Africa. Zambia may take a leaf from Senegal who made the final after hosting the tournament in 2015 falling only to eventual winners Nigeria.

{"article": "Even though the plans are very much in the early stages there have already been a few rows, so it's clear many months of negotiation lie ahead. All the bids talk about district and county councils working more closely together along with local business groups. Some hint at cross-border partnerships. The Suffolk bid looks the most impressive so far. Its glossy publication, Working for a Better Future, sets out the benefits which devolution could bring: 70,000 new homes by 2031, the creation of 5,000 new apprenticeships and the creation of better jobs to help reduce money spent on benefits. It talks about a joined up strategic Suffolk plan and setting up a local employment service to administer universal credit. It also wants the county, rather than Whitehall, to decide how European structural funds and money for transport are spent and it asks for local control of health services. In the bid's introduction Jennie Jenkins, the leader of Babergh Council, said: \"We have chosen to set aside our differences and focus on what's important - making people's lives better.\" The Greater Essex bid also has ambitious plans. Signed by all 15 authorities, it aims to create the fastest growing economy outside London, increasing  economic output from Â£32.5bn to Â£60bn and increasing exports by 100%. County Council leader David Finch said: \"For too long the decisions which impact on the needs and aspirations of the people and businesses in Essex have been taken in Whitehall.  With our local knowledge and democratic accountability we can do better.\" Power sharing Norfolk's bid talks about: \"An exciting proposal that will transform the economy of East Anglia\". It is more vague about how devolution would work, but among its suggestions is the creation of a productivity commission which would look at plugging the skills gap, particularly in rural areas. The Norfolk bid also talks about a wish to work more closely and share powers with Suffolk and perhaps even Cambridgeshire over things like flood protection and the development of road and rail links. At the moment all the councils are pushing a county only solution but they may have to consider something more ambitious. There is concern that compared to London and the so-called Northern Power House, the government may feel that Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk are too small and giving devolution to individual counties may not be very efficient. That's why there's a lot of talk about counties merging in some form or other. A county of East Anglia may suit ministers but what would happen to local accountability? Other questions are up for discussion: If councils are sharing services do we really need district and county councils? What happens in places like Norwich, Ipswich and Southend-on-Sea, where there are city deals? Could more services be run locally instead of from Whitehall? A new start? This could be the start of something big, leading to a change in the way our local government is structured, perhaps even in how we're governed. Some people in local government are concerned. We understand there were several heated discussions leading up to the publication of these bids. There are likely to be many more in the months to come. Devolution is going to be the buzz word for the next few years. The government is keen to encourage regional autonomy, while councils are having to make big savings to their budgets and some believe the two are not unrelated - relieving Whitehall of the burden of wielding the axe. There are plenty of people who think it would benefit the east, but coming up with plans that will be acceptable to government, councils and local voters is likely to take some time.", "question": "The first steps have been taken towards devolution in the eastern @placeholder .

{"article": "The stadium in Lille, France, and Cardiff's fan zone erupted with cheers when the final whistle blew in the Euro 2016 quarter final game, which ended 3-1 against Belgium. It was billed as Wales' biggest game since the 1958 World Cup. The team will now play Portugal in Lyon on Wednesday. In an exhilarating game in northern France, Wales went one better than their 1958 predecessors who reached the last eight of the World Cup. However, the game got off to a tense start after Wales fell behind to Radja Nainggolan's strike in the first 15 minutes. But the team thundered back with Ashley Williams, Hal Robson-Kanu and substitute Sam Vokes proving the goal-scoring heroes. Thousands of Wales fans travelled to Lille for the quarter-final match, with many congregating in the fan zone. Some had faced hours of travel delays at the Eurotunnel to reach the stadium. After the final whistle, Neil Davies, 49, from south Wales, said Wales had played \"brilliantly\" and he had tears in his eyes. He said: \"I thought if Belgium went 1-0 up then that would be it. They did and I thought that's us done. To come back the way we did - unbelievable.\" Paula Hart, 41, from Swansea, said: \"It's just been immense. The Belgian fans have been the best, so fair play to them. \"I'm now thinking about the final. Portugal haven't been great so why not start thinking about it?\" Julian Richards, 31, of Pontypool, said: \"It feels absolutely fantastic. \"What we've had in the quarter-final and what I think we'll have in the semi-final is belief. Belief breeds confidence.\" Mr Richards, who was in the Lille fan zone, said: \"One thing I will say is Belgian fans, best in the world.\" He took his 14-year-old son, Joel, to Lille and he said the Belgian fans had given him flags and glasses. Geraint Thomas, 51, of Menai Bridge, Anglesey, said: \"Here with the proper fans [in the fan zone] it's worth the Â£200 you would have to pay for a ticket.\" And he was unequivocal about where Wales were headed in Euro 2016. \"Next weekend we've going to the final. Forget Portugal, we're going to the final.\" After the game, Aaron Ramsey tweeted: \"What a performance, to a man absolute quality. We have the best staff and fans in the world.\" Gareth Bale wrote: \"DON'T TAKE ME HOME!\" which has become a song popular with fans enjoying their time following Wales in France.

{"article": "When Lib Dem MPs and Lords and members of the Federal Executive gathered to endorse the coalition agreement at Local Government House, Paddy Ashdown backed it, Ming Campbell gave it his blessing; even radical Liberals like Duncan Brack backed the deal with the Conservatives. When it came to a vote just one hand was raised against the agreement. And until now the former MP for Newbury in Berkshire, David Rendel, has not talked about what was a private meeting, but after the local elections he sat down to talk on camera about the reasons why he felt he had to withhold his endorsement. \"It was very lonely being on my own.  I was with a group of about 250 people - all of whom I liked and respected. \"But I said in my speech that I felt this was a short-term government and all we would get would be short-term gains. Come the next election there was every chance we would go back to a minority government and any gains would be wiped out.\" Alone amongst those in the room he concluded that the reaction of the public was not worth the compromise. Lib Dem voters stated conclusively last week that they felt the party was on a train heading in a completely different direction to the ticket they bought.  Now they were hitched to the Conservative engine where previously the third party vote could have many different destinations. Rendel calls the loss of the referendum on electoral reform \"a disaster\" and feels most betrayed by the tuition fee policy. As Higher Education spokesman in Parliament he argued against the introduction of fees by Labour.  Now he says: \"I felt bitterly disappointed by the hash that we made of tuition fees, in so many ways.\" But now he thinks the coalition must continue. \"I don't think there's any point now in ending the coalition at this stage. If we did we would simply lose all the quicker all the short-term gains we have made. \"I think the coalition's got to face up to the fact that the depth, strength and speed at which these cuts have been made is, I think, damaging the recovery.\" As to Nick Clegg's own position as leader, it is difficult to see any Liberal Democrat justifying turning on the man who managed to get such an overwhelming number of party members behind his policies. The decision was also endorsed by a special party conference on 16 May 2010 where it was reported that only 50 voted against out of a total of some 1,500 delegates. But David Rendel will always remember the day he was the only man to stand against the prevailing mood of his party. \"I felt very lonely indeed. You can feel lonelier, I think, when you are standing up amongst colleagues and friends and opposing what they want to do, than you would if you were among enemies and opposing what they want to do.\" \"I felt I was not exactly betraying my friends but clearly I was doing something they would rather I didn't do - and it is never fun to oppose people who you believe in and agree with for the most part, and trust and respect.\"", "question": "A year ago most Liberal Democrat politicians were feeling pleased with themselves .

{"article": "Elizabeth Tracey Mae Wettlaufer of Woodstock, Ontario, appeared in court on Tuesday morning. The victims were residents in two long-term care facilities where Ms Wettlaufer worked and were between 75 and 96 years old. Police said seven of the victims were given a fatal dose of a drug. The victims were five women and three men and were all residents of Caressant Care in Woodstock and Meadow Park in London, Ontario. What we know about accused Canadian nurse \"The victims were administered a drug... there are obviously a number of drugs that are stored and are available in long-term care facilities,\" Woodstock Police Chief William Renton said at a news conference. The chief declined to comment on a possible motive, but did add that investigators are confident that they have identified all victims. Caressant spokesman Lee Griffi said the accused was a registered nurse and left their employment approximately two and a half years ago. \"We deeply regret the additional grief and stress this is imposing on the families involved,\" Mr Griffi said in a written statement. Woodstock is a car industry and agricultural town of some 37,000 people, about 128km (79 miles) west of Toronto. In the residential neighbourhood where the Caressant Care facility is located, few people were seen coming and going. Media were staked outside the property, across from a local school. In the hallway of the adjoining retirement residence, a television could be heard playing the news of Ms Wettlaufer's arrest. An employee at the facility, who was not authorised to speak on the record, told a reporter that it was a shame the actions of one person could colour a whole profession. Ms Wettlaufer was also an employee at Christian Horizons, the long-term care facility confirmed. A spokesperson for the organisation, which was not named in the police investigation, said she stopped working for them in 2007. \"Christian Horizons fully intends to cooperate with the authorities in their investigation in this matter,\" said chief executive Janet Noel-Annable in a statement. The daughter of one of the victims said she felt something was amiss when her father, Aprad Horwath, died at 75 in the Meadow Park facility. \"You don't want to believe any of this until you get to this stage when you're actually hearing it on the radio, and then you know that it's real, and even then it's hard to believe,\" Susan Horvath told AM980 radio in London, Ontario. \"I wanted to talk and just for my dad so that people know what happened to him instead of putting it down as, 'oh he had a stroke' or, 'oh, the old age'.\" Ms Wettlaufer says on her Facebook profile that she studied religious education at London Baptist Bible College before she went to nursing school at Conestoga College in Kitchener, Ontario. She lists Lifeguard Homecare as her current employer. A representative from Lifeguard Homecare has yet to respond to the BBC's calls. On the College of Nurses of Ontario website, Ms Wettlaufer's profile states that she became a registered nurse in August 1995 and then resigned on 30 September 2016. The profile also lists Parker as her former surname, and has recently been updated to note that she is facing murder charges and is remanded in custody. Ms Wettlaufer frequently posted pictures of herself on social media with her elderly parents, and described her passion for animals and the Harry Potter series. \"Father's day is a great reminder of how blessed I am to still have my Dad alive and able to spend time with me\", she wrote beneath a picture of her father. In another post, dated 28 September 2015, Ms Werrlaufer spoke about her difficulties overcoming alcoholism. \"My own voice called to me in the darkness. Others hands lifted me when I chose the light. One year ago today I woke up not dead. 365 days clean and sober,\" she wrote. The deaths took place between 2007 and 2014.

{"article": "He told MPs this lack of detail would not affect Brexit negotiations as he could not foresee a situation in which all EU nationals were told to leave. Ministers say they cannot guarantee EU nationals living in the UK the right to stay without reciprocal assurances. But Labour's Chuka Umunna said this stance was now just a \"pretence\". Prime Minister Theresa May has said she would expect to guarantee all EU citizens currently living in the UK the right to remain after the UK leaves the EU but this will depend on other EU countries offering similar assurances to British citizens living there. Campaigners say this means the two million EU citizens estimated to be living in the UK have been effectively \"left in limbo\" and they must not be used as \"bargaining chips\" in Brexit discussions over issues such as free movement and access to the single market. Giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee for the first time since he was appointed in July, Mr Goodwill said EU nationals made a major contribution to the UK economy and society - in areas such as the health service and agriculture - and he could not envisage a circumstance in which they were told to go home. Pressed by Mr Umunna, he said the government did not have the means of tracking down all EU nationals were it deemed necessary to remove them. \"No we are not in a position and I could not foresee a circumstance where we would want to be in that position,\" he said. \"I can't see a situation in which we would even think of that.\" Citizens of other EU countries living in the UK who are not working do not necessarily have national insurance numbers, resulting in gaps in the official records. Mr Umunna said the disclosure that the UK government \"did not have a clue\" about the number or identity of EU nationals undermined the government's whole public position and ministers should stop \"carrying on with the pretence\" that they had the ability to ask all EU nationals to leave. \"If you can't identify all the EU nationals in our country and be in a position to remove them, what on earth is the point carrying on with the pretence that somehow if you weren't to guarantee them the right to stay, you could get rid of them,\" he said. Mr Goodwill replied: \"I can see the sort of route you are trying to take me down but it is not a route I think we are ever going to be going down.\" The unwillingness of the government to offer a concrete guarantee to EU nationals was not a \"bargaining ploy\" but a reflection of \"how things are\" pending the start of official negotiations, he said. But he added that he couldn't see countries like Poland clamouring \"to have their nationals returned\" as part of the Brexit deal.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Wada was heavily criticised by Olympic officials for its handling of the Russian doping scandal in the build-up to this summer's Rio Games. Reedie's future at the agency has been called into question just days before he stands for re-election. But the 75-year-old Briton told BBC Sport he would fight on as \"the integrity of sport is at stake\". Tensions over Wada's attempt to get Russia banned from the Rio Olympics were laid bare at this week's general assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC). \"There was irritation from a number of national Olympic committees,\" said Reedie, who is also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). \"Just before Rio they would rather sport had not been involved in accusations of the breaching of rules by the Russian authorities, and I understand that, so I had to deal with it and I did deal with it.\" IOC president Thomas Bach told BBC Sport this week he has \"no regrets\" about letting Russia compete at Rio 2016. Media playback is not supported on this device But ANOC president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah - an influential powerbroker in the Olympic movement - has called for a \"neutral\" leader to take charge of Wada. Reedie is due to stand unopposed for a second three-year term at a Wada board meeting this weekend. He had been told he had the IOC's support. \"I've spent 15 years of my life working with Wada,\" he said. \"I don't think it's a particularly good idea if I walk away from it simply because it's getting difficult. \"We've been faced with a difficult situation. I think we're going to come through it, and we have to. The integrity of sport is at stake.\" The Olympic movement is bracing itself for the release next month of a second independent Wada report by professor Richard McLaren into Russian doping. His first report was damning, revealing a systematic cheating programme in the country across many sports. \"If, about three and a half years ago, when I was invited to apply [to be Wada president], somebody had told me this would have happened, it maybe isn't the kind of job that you would volunteer for,\" said Reedie. \"That having been said, there are serious issues involved here. \"The past has been pretty dreadful. I'm really hopeful that once we get the second part of the McLaren report out of the way, we can draw a line under the past and move forward. \"We have to get the Russian anti-doping agency properly compliant again and we need to look at what Wada is currently doing, and see if we can do it better.\" Wada's board meeting in Glasgow this weekend could be pivotal in the debate about how to better protect clean sport following the recent Russian scandal. Many within the anti-doping community want Wada to be strengthened, with greater independence and sanctioning power. However, the sports movement appears reluctant to hand Wada more authority, with Bach suggesting he wants a new Wada-run body to take on responsibility for testing as well as regulation.

He said he is submitting the evidence for Guinness World Records to ratify. The shopping trolley was powered by a modified Chinook helicopter starter engine and a 250cc Honda engine. It is stabilised with go-kart wheels. Following his previous record breaking attempt last month, Mr McKeown vowed to go faster and was invited to the Elvington World Wheelie Records Straightliners event on Sunday. \"It was the first time I've actually been scared driving that thing,\" he said. \"I was quite nervous going out, but when I realised how close I was to getting over 70mph as an average, I thought I'd have to push the boat out a bit and take a bit more of a risk and it paid off.\" Mr McKeown has modified the shopping trolley since his last attempt to include an extra 250cc Honda engine, which works along side the original jet engine. \"I knew I could go faster, so it was actually quite frustrating before. This shows I'm true to my word,\" he said. Describing travelling at over 70mph on the back of the trolley he said: \"Everything about it gets very twitchy and unpredictable the faster you go, and the stability drops off dramatically, so going out there and pushing over 60mph on the first run, was very, very sketchy. \"I remember going out for the final run and thinking this could genuinely go very wrong and be quite painful. I was just pleased to get back to the pits in one piece.\" The record attempt had to be carried out more than once and Guinness World Records will accept the average speed. Mr McKeown is now submitting evidence of the attempt and hopes the record will soon be made official.

{"article": "The Garden Bridge Trust needs to raise an estimated £185m to complete the project. But its latest annual accounts show a shortfall of £56m. However, Garden Bridge Trust chair Lord Davies said trustees still expected construction to start this year. The trust's accounts for 2016 filed with Companies House show it has yet to secure the land on the South Bank of the Thames for the bridge's southern landing. They also show that the trust may need additional funding that would not be repayable \"if the project is not able to proceed\" in the first half of this year. And the accounts raise the possibility that \"in a worst-case scenario\" the trust might have to consider \"whether the project remains viable\". If the project does not go ahead, London mayor Sadiq Khan has estimated that £40m of public money already spent would be lost to taxpayers. In total the trust said it had received financial commitments totalling £129m from private investors, donors or public funds. Of that, £60m is to come from the Department of Transport and Transport for London (TfL), £20m of which will be repaid to TfL by the trust over time. But of the £39m raised in 2016 for the project, £26m came from the DfT, meaning the trust raised only £13m last year. In the accounts, Lord Davies warns: \"Due to material uncertainties in existence ahead of finalising these accounts trustees are unable to conclude that the trust is a going concern and feel it only appropriate to flag these risks. \"It is hoped that these will be resolved over the months ahead but since a number of these risks are outside of the control of the trustees, they recognised that if this is not possible they will need to consider the further delay to the project, and in a worst-case scenario, whether the project remains viable.\" The Garden Bridge has been beset with problems. In September Mr Khan ordered a review into whether the public had so far been given value for money from the project, adding he believed there had not \"been the necessary standard of transparency and openness around the Garden Bridge\". That review, led by Dame Margaret Hodge, a former chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, has yet to report back but Mr Khan has already said that no more taxpayer money will be provided to fund the project. In October it emerged that former prime minister David Cameron had ignored the advice of civil servants over Garden Bridge funding, personally intervening to approve extra taxpayer money for the controversial project. The National Audit Office (NOA) said at the time that nearly £23m of taxpayer money was at risk of being lost.", "question": "The trust behind a project to build a bridge @placeholder with trees and shrubs across the Thames in London has revealed it is \" unable to conclude it is a going concern \" .", "option_0": "built", "option_1": "clash", "option_2": "associated", "option_3": "covered", "option_4": "tasked", "label": 3}
{"article": "\"Your iron industry is dead, dead as mutton. Your coal industries, which depend greatly on the iron industries, are languishing. Your silk industry is dead, assassinated by the foreigner. Your woollen industry is in articulo mortis, gasping, struggling. Your cotton industry is seriously sick. Your shipbuilding industry, which held out longest, is come to a standstill.\" The Latin, the silk and the mutton are a dead giveaway. Not Trump, but Lord Randolph Churchill in 1884 denouncing Free Trade. The system he preferred - \"Fair Trade\" - is coming back into fashion. We have heard a lot about the revolt against the political elites, the backlash by those \"left behind\" by globalization; a lot about the movements and political personalities this has brought to the fore; a lot about the implications for immigration. But not so much about the economics of it all. It many signal a new rejection of one of the global elite's most cherished policies - free trade. This is the notion that the fewer economic barriers around the world, and the less countries protect their own goods and trade with special policies, the richer we all end up. The opposite is protectionism - making foreign goods more expensive by putting taxes on their import , tariffs, in order to make home-grown products cheaper by comparison. While few embrace the word protectionism, growing numbers of politicians are openly embracing the principle behind it. Donald Trump has said he would put a swingeing 45% tax on goods from China and 35% on many from Mexico. Many economists mock this as crazy stuff, but it is a sentiment that goes down well with many Americans. I remember well talking to a wide variety of people at \"the biggest little flea market in the world\" in Kentucky, including a man sadly selling Western-style cowboy belts made in China. Just about everyone I spoke to complained about \"the jobs going to Mexico and China\". Trump is not alone, and this is a sentiment not only of the right. Bernie Sanders has made it very clear he is opposed to NAFTA, the free trade bloc with Mexico and Canada, and the planned Asia Pacific agreement. Trans-Pacific Partnership: What is it and why does it matter? He has been saying it for a while. This is him in 2011: \"Let's be clear: one of the major reasons that the middle class in America is disappearing, poverty is increasing and the gap between the rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider, is due to our disastrous unfettered free trade policy.\" The fringe has come to the fore. That changes the mood of the mainstream too. The person still most likely to end up in the White House, Hillary Clinton, was once a fierce defender of the Asia deal. She now says: \"I do absorb new information. I do look at what's happening in the world. Take the trade deal. I did say, when I was secretary of state three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. \"It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards…. I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say: 'this will help raise your wages'. And I concluded I could not.\" What the US does will set the tone for the rest of the world. And the enthusiasm for free trade is being increasingly questioned in the rest of the world. The \"Vote Leave\" campaign here advocates free trade, and says it will continue if we vote to exit the European Union. But opponents point out that, in at least a couple of possible futures, new tariffs would be imposed on us. One passionate Brexit campaigner, the entrepreneur and inventor Sir James Dyson, faces that prospect with equanimity. He told the Telegraph: \"If, as David Cameron suggested, they imposed a tariff of 10% on us, we will do the same in return. We buy more from Europe than they buy from us, so we would be the net beneficiary, and based on these numbers it would bring £10bn into the UK annually.\" A debate that seemed all but settled with the repeal of the Corn Laws  in the UK could about to become one of the most central issues in politics. In Our Time: The Corn Laws It is worth remembering that argument split the Conservative Party between its economic liberal and nationalist wings. Again the left has its own concerns. Jeremy Corbyn may be campaigning with 75% commitment to remain in the EU, but he is against the Free Trade deal (TTIP) with the US. TTIP: The EU-US trade deal explained The EU itself is, formally, a great supporter of free trade, while there is a suspicion that on the sly countries like France give advantage to their own industries, whenever  they can get away with it. But Europe's fastest growing economy has announced this week a more open breach with the internationalist philosophy. The determinately populist ruling party in Poland, has just declared a \"Farewell to Neoliberalism\". The deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declares the nation is too dependent on foreign money: \"We want the invisible hand of the market supported by the visible hand of the state\". The Hungarian Prime Minister has been following a similar path for some time. This reaction, in the US and Europe, is part of the aftershock of the 2008 economic crisis and the sense of frustration and powerlessness felt by many voters. But free trade is not just questioned in the West. China has recently imposed 46% tariffs on certain types of steel. While it is attempting to close down loss-making \"zombie industries\" the primacy of the party is all, and it will not allow unfettered international competition threaten social stability. And the Chinese are the main target of such measures by countries around the globe. Researchers believe free trade has been under attack for several years. The 2015 report from the Centre for Economic Policy Research's Global Trade Alert, says: \"the 'level playing field' has taken a battering this year … governments imposed 539 trade distortions in the first ten months of this year, of which the G20 were responsible for 443\". Another report from last year, by the EU, also finds backsliding, claiming the G20 is breaking its promises: \"(the) pledge to refrain from adopting new trade-restrictive measures - and to roll back those in place - has not been honoured.... What is more, trade restriction has shifted eastwards, with Russia, China, India and Indonesia among the main offenders\". This is a huge challenge to the rebalancing of the world economy which we cover with the dustsheet rubric \"globalisation\". National politicians have always put their own country's economic interests first. But for decades those in power have argued economics is not a zero-sum game, and what benefits one benefits all. While the game hasn't quite changed to \"beggar thy neighbour\" those who want to look after the left-behinds, or at least court their votes, may clamour for a contest where the richer nations reassert their self-perceived right to be top dog.", "question": "Which politician has captured the curve , summed up a growing mood , in a ferocious @placeholder ?", "option_0": "speech", "option_1": "battle", "option_2": "media", "option_3": "show", "option_4": "mood", "label": 0}
{"article": "This happened in the 1960s in Cessnock, a former mining town in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, but only now has this and other decades-old stories of sexual violence and degradation been heard, catalogued and, crucially for many victims, believed. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse is an unprecedented investigation into an epidemic of depravity across Australia. The far-reaching inquiry began in 2013 and has heard from thousands of survivors of paedophiles who worked, or volunteered, in sporting clubs, schools, churches, charities, childcare centres and the military. It has the power to look at any private, public or non-government body that is, or was, involved with children. The Commission's task is to make recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to protect the young. To date, it has held more than 6,000 private sessions, along with several high-profile public hearings. Paul Gray told investigators that between the ages of 10 and 14, he was sexually assaulted by Father Peter Rushton in Cessnock every one or two weeks. Sometimes, his attacker had an accomplice. \"I was chased by two men to the edge of the cliff and I hid in the bushes. \"After a while they dragged me from the bushes and I was raped by the two men, and while I was being raped I could hear another boy screaming,\" said Mr Gray, fighting back tears as he recounted memories that have burned inside him for half a century. Too ill to travel from the Vatican to Sydney to give evidence, Australia's most prominent churchman, Cardinal George Pell, was questioned via video link by the Royal Commission over what he knew about alleged abuse and cover-ups within the Catholic Church. For four days earlier this year, the senior Vatican official was quizzed, denying any personal wrongdoing but conceding the organisation had made grave errors. \"I am not here to defend the indefensible,\" said Cardinal Pell. \"The Church has made enormous mistakes, is working to remedy those, but the Church has in many places - certainly in Australia - mucked things up.\" When he was 13, John Ellis, a former altar boy, was molested by an Australian monk who was also implicated in a suspected paedophile ring at a former Catholic boarding school in the Scottish Highlands. Now a solicitor, Mr Ellis works with other victims, and we meet at a public hearing held by the commission on the 17th floor of Governor Macquarie Tower that stands over central Sydney. Presiding over the session is the chief royal commissioner, Justice Peter McClellan, a judge of appeal in New South Wales. He is one of six commissioners; two women and four men, and they include a former Queensland police chief, a consultant child psychiatrist and a retired federal politician. They have fanned out across Australia to document a nation's shame. \"The most important thing for people in being invited to give their own stories and having their stories valued is that somebody cares,\" Mr Ellis told the BBC news website. \"For many, many years people have been silenced, people have been fearful of what reaction they will get if they were to tell their truth. The overwhelming emotion people have when they have had that opportunity is empowerment.\" When it hands down its final report at the end of 2017, this painstaking inquiry will have lasted for almost five years.  Already, more than 1,700 cases have been referred to the authorities, including the police. More prosecutions will almost certainly follow, but many victims will never savour justice. Dr Wayne Chamley, from Broken Rites, a group that gives a voice to the abused, said decades of brutality had left a terrible legacy. \"When you look at the rate of suicide for men who had these experiences and compared it with age-matched data from the coroners' courts, their risk factor is 20 to 40 times higher for suicide,\" he explained to the BBC. \"There are townships where there have been waves of suicide with hundreds of men. [In] Ballarat [in Victoria state], at least 50 or 60 suicides across just three classes in the primary school - just three classes of boys who became men. Bang. Devastating.\" Gerard McDonald, 52, is a survivor of abuse, and one of thousands of people who have told their stories to the commission. His attacker, a Catholic priest, has spent 14 years in prison for attacking 35 boys. \"After every other altar boy practice in 1975, before dropping me home Father (Vincent) Ryan would sexually abuse me. All I could do was think about running to my mate's place and getting the biggest two knives he had and killing him,\" he said.

The company reiterated its existing complete bans of illegal content, including child abuse images and so-called \"revenge porn\". Some users argue the site is acting against its free speech principles. Newly-instated chief executive and co-founder Steve Huffman told users: \"We've spent the last few days here discussing, and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don't want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose.\" He made the announcement after over a week of controversy surrounding the site's policies, its management and direction.

Other users are then able to up- or down-vote links, meaning the most popular content surfaces to the top and is more prominent. The site is divided into subreddits for certain topics, such as r/technology or r/worldnews. However, some subreddits deal with extremely dark material - such as the sharing of images of dead bodies, or extremely racist material that advocates violence. It is this material that will be hidden away, but not deleted, Mr Huffman said. \"This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit,\" he said, adding that such areas violated \"a common sense of decency\".

Scotland has the highest proportion of concerned GPs, according to the British Medical Association national survey. A quarter (25%) said their workload was \"unmanageable\". A further 17% said their workload \"significantly negatively impacts\" on the quality of care they can provide. Three-fifths (60%) of doctors in Scotland who took part in the 2015 national survey described their workload as being \"generally manageable\" but \"too heavy at times\". Only 8% thought having 10 minutes for each consultation was sufficient time, with 63% wanting longer consultations for certain groups of patients - such as those with long-term conditions - and 30% saying there should be more time available for all patients. A total of 1,844 doctors in Scotland took part in the research, with the BMA saying this represented 37% of all GPs in the country. When asked what would help them deliver the \"essential components of general practice\", 75% wanted longer consultation times, 74% believe there should be more GPs and 69% responded that increased core funding for practices would make a difference. Dr Colette Maule, co-negotiator of the BMA's Scottish GP committee, said: \"This survey reflects the immense pressure that GPs working across Scotland are feeling just now. \"The rising workload is simply unsustainable and something has to change otherwise general practice will break. \"Giving us more time with patients, expanding the GP workforce and supporting the practice-based primary care team will help to ensure the quality of care our patients receive remains of a high standard. \"In addition, providing stable funding arrangements to meet the rising costs of providing increasingly complex care in the community will alleviate some of the helplessness that GPs are clearly feeling just now. \"Politicians need to stop fixating on how they can demand more from general practice and instead focus on what they can do to support GPs to provide the quality of care that our patients deserve within the constraints that exist.\" Health Secretary Shona Robison said: \"The recently-agreed new GP contract in Scotland will give general practice financial stability, reducing the bureaucratic burden and freeing up GPs to spend more time with patients. \"Individual GP practices determine their appointment and consultation arrangements. \"The length of a consultation will vary depending on the clinical needs of the individual patient and is a matter of professional judgement for the GP.\" Ms Robison added: \"The Scottish government is determined to continue supporting and sustaining Scottish general practice.

{"article": "In some cases, ISPs are advertising services as fibre that rely on slower copper wires for the final link to a customer's home. The probe has been prompted by consumer complaints and calls from MP Matt Warman to investigate. Mr Warman said ISPs were misleading customers by giving them copper when they expected fibre. In a statement, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it was acting because of \"evolving concerns\" about the way fibre broadband services were advertised, and recent changes to government policy, which meant far more people would potentially have access to such services. Policy papers spelling out the government's view made clear that fibre should be used only to describe services that rely on the faster cables from end to end, it said. The ASA said it would consider whether ISPs should be able to continue using \"fibre broadband\" to describe both full and part-fibre services. \"We will be considering whether the use of that term is likely to cause people to be materially misled,\" it said. The ASA did not say when it would complete its work but said it would provide an update by the summer. James Blessing, chair of the council at the UK's Internet Service Providers Association said it had been \"working with the ASA on their wider review into broadband advertising to ensure that adverts are understood by consumers and help them make informed choices about the services, products and technologies that best suit their needs.\" He said ISPA \"looked forward\" to helping the ASA's review of what the word \"fibre\" means in adverts. Andrew Ferguson, co-founder of the ThinkBroadband website, said \"clarity\" on advertising would be welcome. \"Then we can avoid adverts that promote fibre optic broadband but clearly show a coax cable with a metal core,\" he said. Telecoms watchdog Ofcom offers an app that can help consumers check broadband speeds and availability. Commercial sites. such as ThinkBroadband and USwitch, have also made tools that let people check deals and speeds available.", "question": "The UK 's advertising watchdog is looking into the way so - called \" fibre broadband \" services are @placeholder .", "option_0": "operated", "option_1": "restricting", "option_2": "warned", "option_3": "struggling", "option_4": "marketed", "label": 4}
{"article": "The Bulls' fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead. Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South. \"Hereford United can have no complaints. The Conference bent over backwards to help them. \"I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking. \"It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves. \"You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.\" The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June. The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000. That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June. But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted. The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010. They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up. By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane. 26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season 29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for £1 and clear their £220,000 debts 22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too 2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice 3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner 5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote 6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June 10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary. When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000. They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street. But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option. Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover. The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates. The average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.", "question": "Hereford United have been expelled from the Football Conference following the club 's failure to pay their @placeholder .", "option_0": "due", "option_1": "fate", "option_2": "hands", "option_3": "bills", "option_4": "future", "label": 3}
{"article": "Small businesses are the clear winners from the Budget with big businesses picking up the bill - and then some. The biggest beef for small businesses are rates, which far exceed the amount they pay in corporation tax, and there were hopes they would be reduced. Mr Osborne has obliged, announcing 630,000 small businesses will pay no business rates at all from next year. He claims the reduction will save Â£7bn per year for businesses. The bill for that will fall to big corporations. Big firms face a crackdown on practices which reduce taxable profits, including offsetting debt interest against profits and using losses in one year to offset profits in another. The government says this combination of measures will raise Â£9bn. Yet in the past, measures to crack down on tax avoidance have had mixed success and the chancellor is relying heavily on it to fund his small business initiatives. Businesses big and small will be grateful he didn't raise fuel duty. The \"feel good factor\" that creates is at least as important as the threat of a Tory backbench riot. However, these trades between big and small are all overshadowed by the central view of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that the single most important measure of an economy - its productivity growth - looks permanently damaged.

{"article": "First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, and their Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat counterparts all voiced their support for a law change. Their calls come ahead of a major gay rights rally in Belfast on Saturday. Northern Ireland is the only part of the British Isles where same-sex marriage is outlawed. The issue has long been a divisive one, with attempts to introduce it having been blocked by the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The party rejects claims that it is homophobic, and has said it is protecting the \"traditional\" definition of marriage. The matter has become a sticking point in talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in aimed at restoring power-sharing at Stormont. Earlier this week, celebrities, including actor Liam Neeson and TV presenter Graham Norton, added their backing to the same-sex marriage campaign. A bill to allow same-sex marriages in Scotland was overwhelmingly approved by the region's parliament in 2014, and the heads of its five main parties have now said the same measure should be introduced in Northern Ireland. Ms Sturgeon said she was proud to have supported same-sex marriage in Scotland and was \"thrilled to see the positive reaction\" to it. \"The debate over equal marriage in Scotland did more than just simply allow people to marry,\" she said. \"It also helped to challenge negative attitudes that still exist today in our society towards LGBTI people and show, quite simply, that same-sex couples are just as valued as opposite sex couples.\" Ms Davidson said she was \"optimistic this is a battle that can be won\". \"Equal marriage isn't about one religion or country or community - it's much simpler than that,\" the Scottish Tory leader said. \"At its heart, equal marriage is about the people of Northern Ireland being afforded the same rights as everybody else. \"Change is coming. And it's a change for the better.\" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said that the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Scotland, England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland has been \"liberating and encouraging\". The debate on the matter in Northern Ireland should be \"conducted courteously\", Ms Dugdale said, adding: \"It's time for LGBT people across the whole of the UK to enjoy the right to marry who they want.\" Patrick Harvie, the co-convener of the Scottish Green Party, said gay rights campaigners would not \"accept that the prejudice of the DUP will never be overcome\". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the \"world has not collapsed\" since gay marriages first took place in Scotland.

{"article": "Former Deal or No Deal producer Richard Osman, who now co-presents Pointless, told how one contestant's partner had said she needed £15,000 for treatment. The next day the singer phoned in to donate the money, Osman tweeted. Family and friends were touched \"beyond words\" by the \"outpouring of love\" from Michael's fans, his publicist said. Other stories of the star's benevolence, including a £50,000 Sport Relief donation, have emerged on social media. In a string of tweets celebrating the singer's music and humour, comedian and author David Walliams tweeted that the star had supported his 2006 cross-Channel swim to the tune of £50,000. Osman tweeted in the hours following news that Michael had been found dead at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on Christmas Day, aged 53. The presenter wrote: \"A woman on 'Deal Or No Deal' told us she needed £15k for IVF treatment. \"George Michael secretly phoned the next day and gave her the £15k.\" The beneficiary was later reported to be Lynette Gillard, 38, from Bolton, whose partner Steve Davies had appeared on the show in 2008. She told the Telegraph: \"For many years I wondered who would have been so generous and now I know. What more can I say other than 'Thank you George'.\" At the time, in 2008, Mr Davies had told the Manchester Evening News: \"Thank you is not enough. It restores your faith in humankind. \"All the bad news you read about and then something like this happens.\" Michael's donations ranged in scope from major charities and appeals to individual acts of kindness. The proceeds from sales of Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me, his 1991 live duet with Sir Elton John, were donated to HIV and children's charities, including the Terence Higgins Trust. It tweeted: \"Thank you to George Michael for all he did for the LGBT community and to educate about HIV. RIP George.\" Michael's family and close friends thanked fans for their \"many, many, kind words\", his publicist said in a statement. \"There can be no more fitting tribute\", the statement said. \"We thank those who, rightly, have chosen to celebrate his life and legacy.\" Wham! royalties from Last Christmas went to Ethiopian famine relief efforts, while the founder of the children's helpline charity Childline, Dame Esther Rantzen, said Michael had donated royalties from the song Jesus to a Child to the cause. \"He really wanted to keep his help secret, it was an intensely personal gift,\" Dame Esther told BBC News. \"It meant we could answer more children.\" She said Michael, who she estimated had donated around £2m to Childline over the years, \"completely understood\" the importance of helping children. \"Maybe he felt their pain or understood from a personal perspective,\" she said. Children's charities were also at the fore when he donated each year to Capital Radio's appeal. Former presenter Mick Brown tweeted: \"Every Easter at Capital when I was on air with Chris Tarrant for help a London child, George would call in at 3.30pm with a £100,000 donation.\" He also suffered the loss of his mother to cancer in 1997 and in 2006 played a special, free concert at the Roundhouse in Camden, north London, for NHS nurses to thank them for their care. And he gave his time to Macmillan Cancer Support as one of their ambassadors. Alongside major charities, individuals on Twitter shared their accounts of his kindness. Journalist Sali Hughes said: \"I wrote in a piece ages ago about a celeb I'd worked with tipping a barmaid £5k because she was a student nurse in debt. Was George Michael.\" And Emilyne Mondo said he had worked anonymously at a homeless shelter where she volunteered. Michael's partner Fadi Fawaz, says he found the singer dead when he went to his home in Goring on Christmas Day. He told the Telegraph: \"We were supposed to be going for Christmas lunch. \"I went round there to wake him up and he was just gone, lying peacefully in bed. We don't know what happened yet. \"George was looking forward to Christmas, and so was I.
