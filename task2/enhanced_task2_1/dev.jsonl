Yeovil remain bottom after four league defeats since their promotion in 2016. The Lady Glovers fell behind early on to England striker Jodie Taylor's penalty and it was soon 2-0 to Arsenal through Molly Clark's own goal.

{"article": "They are holding an inquiry into the procedure, used to ease incontinence, after some women experienced painful complications. Last year, the then Scottish health secretary Alex Neil urged health boards to suspend use of the implants. Adam Slater, a US compensation lawyer, said \"women are not told the truth\" about the devices. He was lead trial counsel in the first pelvic mesh trial against Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon, resulting in a compensatory and punitive damages verdict of $11.1m. Giving evidence to members of the Scottish Parliament committee via videoconference, Mr Slater said the closest comparison to the mesh implant situation he could think of was asbestos. He said: \"Something that was thought to be a wonderful invention for a long time and now everybody in the world knows it's something you wouldn't want to go near. \"It's the closest analogy I can find to these horrible devices that are now in so many women.\" The committee is considering calls to suspend mesh implant operations. Operations continue to be carried out by some health boards despite the health secretary's call to stop using them. Mr Slater has worked almost exclusively on mesh cases in the US since 2007 and is currently the lead counsel for more than 7,000 cases in New Jersey. He said some doctors are now refusing to use the devices, with one even branding them a \"social cancer\". He told MSPs that studies into the safety of mesh have been influenced by manufacturers, who enjoy a \"close relationship\" with regulators of the products. The lawyer said thousands of women in the US are suing both manufacturers and doctors on the grounds that mesh devices are defective or that there was a failure to warn them about the dangers and complications. The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), indicated last April that it plans to reclassify mesh for pelvic organ prolapse as \"high risk\", but is yet to do so. Mr Slater urged UK regulator the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to \"look at the studies that are relied on by the mesh manufacturers\". \"Most of the studies they rely on are written or investigated by paid consultants,\" he said. \"I would throw those in the garbage immediately because if somebody is being paid by the manufacturer, there is a financial bias.\" He added: \"There has never been a high-level study...that has ever been done that has proven the mesh to be safe and effective.\"", "question": "Vaginal mesh implants are as dangerous as asbestos , MSPs on Holyrood 's @placeholder committee have been told .", "option_0": "petitions", "option_1": "ethics", "option_2": "state", "option_3": "membership", "option_4": "developing", "label": 0}
{"article": "On the ITV Wales Election Debate, First Minister Carwyn Jones said he had \"never seen a UK government so unprepared for anything\". But Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said UK ministers had a \"serious plan\". Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood said she would ensure Wales' voice was heard, while UKIP's Neil Hamilton said Britain had \"masses to gain\" from Brexit. Some 85% of the world economy was outside the EU bloc, he said. \"We can do our own trade deals with the rest of the world,\" Mr Hamilton, leader of UKIP's group in the Welsh Assembly, added. Ms Wood said her party had a \"positive Brexit plan\" focused on \"protecting the 200,000 jobs in Wales that rely on tariff-free access to the EU single market\". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Mark Williams insisted there had to be a second referendum for people to ratify any deal with the EU. \"Nobody knows what Brexit will look like - we believe in giving voters the say on the terms of the deal with a ratification referendum,\" he said. During the two hour programme there were also robust exchanges over what the appropriate level of taxation should be. Defending Labour plans to raise taxes on higher earners, Mr Jones said: \"For me it's a matter of making sure that I contribute fairly to public services that people want to see. \"There was a time when we had a much more equal society, a much fairer society, when the broadest shoulders shouldered more of the burden.\" Mr Davies said the UK government's cuts to corporation taxes had brought more money into the Treasury, by stimulating firms to invest. Under Labour, he warned, business confidence would \"drain away\" because money would be taken from firms to fund \"pie in the sky policies\". Ms Wood said Plaid Cymru \"would only vote for taxes on the very richest in society to go up\". \"We won't increase the tax burden for those who are the least well off in society,\" she said. She added that Plaid wanted Wales to have control of VAT and corporation tax to so they could be set in such a way as to encourage job creation. Mr Williams said the Lib Dems would raise Â£21bn over five years by \"cutting the Tories' cut to corporation tax\". This would help fund extra investment in the NHS, social care and mental health services \"which are grievously lacking across this country\", he said. Mr Hamilton said UKIP would not be in favour of increasing income tax at \"any level\". Debating immigration, Mr Hamilton accused Theresa May, who was home secretary before becoming prime minister, of being responsible for adding two million people to the UK population. Defending the benefits of immigration, Mr Williams said skilled migrants kept the NHS running. \"This is about Wales being a warm tolerant and embracing country,\" he said. Mr Davies said it was vital questions about immigration were addressed, but that the UK should stay \"open\". Mr Jones said a \"common sense\" immigration policy was needed that did not jeopardize job creation.

{"article": "Jasurbek Ibragimov was badly beaten, allegedly by a group of students who bullied him. He died in hospital a month later. His death could have gone unnoticed. However, it has turned out to be a major shake-up for the repressive system in Uzbekistan. Shortly before Jasurbek's death, his mother wrote a letter to the president asking for justice. That letter went viral on social media and Facebook and Telegram groups copied and shared the text. Those who beat Jasurbek to death, Nilufar Aliyeva wrote, bragged that they could get away with it since their parents who were lawyers could buy the police. It was this feeling of impunity that made people particularly furious about this case. Heated discussions online resulted in a gathering in the capital Tashkent where people signed a petition, demanding to those responsible for Jasurbek's death be punished. About 600 people signed the petition. But don't be misled by that figure. For Uzbekistan, this kind of gathering is extremely rare. The last time a crowd tried to voice their demands, the military opened fire at them. That was in Andijan in 2005. Hundreds were killed. Uzbekistan is regarded as one of the most repressive states in the world. Its human rights record is abysmal and any uncontrolled civil initiative is treated as a potential threat for the regime. In the case of Jasurbek's death, many citizens seem to realise that they could pressurise government offices by speaking up. And it worked. A criminal case was finally opened shortly after Nilufar Aliyeva wrote her letter to the president. The public outcry forced the law enforcement agencies to share information about the investigation with the public. Local media that usually remain silent reprinted the letter of Jasurbek's mother. The head of the medical college where Jasurbek studied was sacked. But what makes this case unusual is that the government is not trying to suppress the initiative. On the contrary, they tried to assist the petitioners when they gathered to sign the document. \"It was very nice to see law enforcement officers who actually tried to help us,\" Mariya Legler, one of the co-ordinators who gathered signatures, said. \"They helped to co-ordinate and manage the crowd to ensure that the gathering was not messy and people wouldn't push each other. They answered the questions people raised.\" In a repressive state like Uzbekistan people normally don't dare to ask police questions. Usually it's the opposite. So far one of the suspected attackers has been arrested and charged with aggravated battery that led to the death of the victim. Police are questioning witnesses to try to identify other individuals involved in the crime. The investigation is continuing. Such an initiative is unlikely to have been welcomed under the rule of the late Islam Karimov who died last September. New President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has introduced a number of changes suggesting a certain degree of liberalisation. He improved relations with neighbouring states that were extremely tense under Karimov. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development resumed its operations that were halted a decade ago. Several long-held political prisoners were released and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights visited the country for the first time. Some major reforms like floating the currency and introducing visa free regime were held up. The news agency Reuters reported, citing sources, that that was due to opposition from security service chief Rustam Inoyatov. It is not clear whether Mr Mirziyoyev will continue with his reforms once the alleged infighting is over or whether he will turn to authoritarianism after he consolidates power in his hands. But the case of Jasurbek's death illustrates how reforms can encourage a grassroots movement. Like Islam Karimov, Mr Mirziyoyev may see it as a threat to his power. Yet so far his presidency has been more promising than many expected.", "question": "In early May , Nilufar Aliyeva received a phone call from her 17 - year - old son Jasurbek .

A family spokesman said there had been an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\". The group was accused of watching terrorist videos but had only viewed a BBC Genghis Khan documentary, he said. It was \"to further their understanding of the region they were in at the time, and this may have mistakenly been deemed as 'propaganda' material\", he said. The tour group members were held at Ordos airport 30 days into their 47-day visit to the sites of ancient China and taken to a detention centre in the city. Six Britons and five South Africans had already been released on 15 July. The remaining nine tourists - three Britons, two dual UK-South African citizens, three South Africans and an Indian national - were freed two days later. The final Britons to be released included Hoosain Jacobs, 74, and his wife Tahira, 68, from west London. Explaining the circumstances behind their arrest, the Jacobs family spokesman added: \"While the experience was distressing in the first instance, they say they were looked after at all times and treated well. \"The group is a mixture of multi-faith men and women from Islamic, Christian and Hindu religions who knew each other well and had travelled the world together in the past, including Israel and the USA.\" He said the arrests came the day after a visit to the Genghis Khan Mausoleum at Ordos. He added that nobody in the group had been charged after they were detained. \"It can only be assumed that junior officials who made the initial arrest in Inner Mongolia made a mistake, due to perhaps their unfamiliarity of the English language. \"The Jacobs family wish to thank the senior Chinese authorities in Beijing for the swift manner in which they have resolved this unfortunate misunderstanding.\" A Foreign Office spokesman on Friday confirmed officials had been informed that the final three British nationals were to be deported.

{"article": "Thursday's protest was largely peaceful after violence a day earlier during which one person was fatally shot. Keith Lamont Scott's family dispute police allegations he was armed and want video recording to be released. Excessive police force used against black men has been the subject of protests for two years across the US. On Tuesday, Mr Scott was killed in Charlotte after police say he refused to drop a gun he was carrying. His family say he was unarmed and holding a book. Police have released a video of the shooting to the family, but have refused to make it public. The family's lawyer, Justin Bamberg, said no gun was visible in the video and Mr Scott appeared to be \"acting calm\". \"You do see something in his hand, but it's impossible to make out from the video what it is.\" Police chief Kerr Putney said the video proved the shooting was justified, telling Fox news: \"The officer perceived his failure to comply with commands, failure to drop the weapon and facing the officers as an imminent threat.\" On Thursday, demonstrators protesting against Mr Scott's death defied a curfew put into force by the city's mayor on Thursday - running from midnight to 06:00. According to Cpt Mike Campagna, officers did not enforce the curfew as protests were largely peaceful, with some on the street singing gospel songs. However Charlotte police reported two officers were injured. Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed on the streets to protect the city against further violence and property damage. It followed Wednesday's protest during which protesters smashed windows of hotels and restaurants, set fires, and attacked reporters. Peaceful demonstrations took place in the aftermath of last week's shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. On Thursday, officer Betty Shelby was charged with manslaughter for shooting an unarmed man. Prosecutors said her decision to shoot Terence Crutcher was \"unreasonable\". Video of the incident shows Mr Crutcher with his hands up, leaning against the car. Officer Shelby said Mr Crutcher had not followed her commands and she had opened fire when he began to reach into his car window. As well as being shot, Mr Crutcher was also struck with a stun gun by another officer. Ms Shelby's lawyer, Scott Wood, has said she believed Mr Crutcher was under the influence of the synthetic drug PCP. A vial of the drug was found in the car. His family have disputed Ms Shelby's claim, arguing that his window was closed at the time of the incident. Police have said no gun was found on Mr Crutcher or inside his vehicle. The US justice department has also opened a separate investigation to see if Mr Crutcher's civil rights were violated. If convicted, Ms Shelby faces a minimum of four years in prison. After the charge, a small group of demonstrators gathered to demand a harsher sentence. Just four days before the first presidential debate, Republican Donald Trump said the violence from the Charlotte protests was largely due to drugs. \"If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,\" he said. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine said the list of black men fatally shot by police had \"grown too long\" and the country needed to confront the issue of racial tensions.

{"article": "It is a well-thumbed copy of Catch 22, Joseph Heller's classic satirical novel on the absurdities of war; not an inappropriate choice for somebody who's spent her entire life amid one of the Middle East's most intractable conflicts. But Rawan's life is about to take a different direction. Currently a student at Gaza's Islamic University, she has just won a scholarship to Oxford University to study linguistics and Italian. She is looking forward to moving from the minarets of Gaza to the city of \"dreaming spires\". \"I'm very excited. I can't wait,\" she smiles. \"It's going to be different but it's going to be fun.\" Few have made such a journey. But what is even more unusual is that all the other students at Oxford's Jesus College will pay some of the cost of Rawan's studies. As part of the recently established Jesus College Junior Members Scholarship most of the other students have each agreed to pay Â£3.90 ($5.90) per term towards Rawan's fees. The scholarship was set up by Oxford graduate Emily Dreyfus after she realised that few Gazans had ever had the chance to study at one of Britain's most prestigious universities. She says most other students at Jesus were happy to contribute. \"They voted for this from the outset. They recognise that this is a very small contribution to make which has a disproportionately positive benefit.\" The student contributions will raise around Â£6,300 a year towards Rawan's living costs. This is only a fraction of the estimated Â£30,000 annual costs needed to complete the four-year course. But the university has agreed to waive around 60% of the tuition fees. The rest of the costs are being paid for by three charities: The Hani Qaddumi Scholarship Foundation, the AM Qattan Foundation and the Hoping Foundation which supports Palestinian refugees around the world. Rawan still had to apply for and win the place against fierce competition, but she knows the other students at Jesus have given her a rare opportunity. \"I really appreciate that Emily believed in people here and she gave somebody like me a life changing chance,\" she says. Rawan has only once before left the tiny Palestinian territory, when she went on a study trip to the United States. Israel's blockade of Gaza and the ongoing conflict with Hamas which governs here make it difficult for Palestinians to leave through Israel. In the past, Israel has refused permission for Palestinian students to leave Gaza in order to carry out studies abroad. It is likely Rawan will leave Gaza through Egypt in order to travel to Oxford. She is currently completing a degree in English literature studying, among other books, George Orwell's Animal Farm and William Golding's Lord of the Flies. She says her favourite book is Mornings In Jenin by the Palestinian American writer Susan AbulHawa. The novel follows the story of three generations of a Palestinian family who became refugees after the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Rawan is also a fan of JK Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books. \"Her style of writing is very subtle. There are little things in her stories that grab your attention.\" Education is highly valued in Gaza. There are no fewer than seven universities in the territory for a population of 1.7 million people. But Rawan is expecting a different study experience at Oxford. \"The education system is completely different. I'm going to have my own tutors not like in Gaza where I am among hundreds of students who have the same teacher.\" She will also have to get used to mixed education. At the Islamic University, where she studies now, men and women are taught separately. \"I don't think it's going to be a problem. The culture there is obviously very different but I'm open to that.\" Rawan also accepts that she is going to miss home. \"Of course I will be homesick. But I have to go through that and get used to it because I have something more important to achieve.\" Emily Dreyfus expects the young Palestinian will be given a warm welcome. \"I'm confident that she's going to have a wonderful time and I know that there are a lot of people at the college eager to meet her and to welcome her to their community.\" And Rawan is looking forward to telling people about a different side of life in Gaza. \"Most people think it's like a war zone here and that everyone here is really depressed and involved in politics,\" she says. \"But it's not always about war. It's also about families, friends and love.

{"article": "The manhunt began after a witness said the teenager, named as Marcel Hesse, had revealed his attack on the child on the messaging service Whatsapp. Pictures of the scene were also posted on the internet. Police in the western city of Bochum said the suspect had also boasted in a chat-room about murdering a woman. Although they could not confirm the second murder, investigators said the teenager had claimed the woman \"put up more of a fight than the child\" and weighed some 120kg (19 stone). The motive for his attack appeared to have been the woman's bank, computer and phone details. As the search for Marcel Hesse spread across the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia on Wednesday, a school was placed under lockdown for several hours some 30km (18 miles) away. Police in the town of Wetter said nothing suspicious was found. Children were told to play indoors at kindergartens in Herne, south of Bochum, where the boy died. Police have warned the public that the teenager may be armed. Reports said he was an unemployed martial arts enthusiast. The boy died of multiple stab wounds on Monday evening. In the message posted on Whatsapp, the suspect had suggested he had wanted to kill himself but failed and murdered the boy instead. The boy's family told German media that the teenager had asked him to help with a ladder. The boy's stepfather went to search for the boy, and found his body in Marcel Hesse's cellar.

{"article": "But she told the BBC from the hospital where her daughter is receiving treatment that she is thankful for the support the family has received worldwide. \"I am very grateful to all the people who have supported us through this ordeal,\" she said. Her daughter was attacked and repeatedly raped by six men in June as she returned from her grandfather's funeral in Tingolo village in Busia County, western Kenya. Her unconscious body was thrown into a pit latrine and she is now in a wheelchair. Her case caused an uproar after Kenya's influential Daily Nation newspaper reported that the police in Busia had asked three of the suspects she identified as her rapists to cut grass as punishment and had chosen not to prosecute them. In a BBC interview on Thursday, Police Inspector General David Kimaiyo said an investigation into the girl's allegation had been concluded, but still no decision had been taken on whether it was a rape case. He said he was unaware that her alleged attackers were ordered to cut grass and that the case was reported to police only two months after \"the incident\". But several hundred activists in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, carrying placards, waving underwear and beating drums marched to the police headquarters, where the inspector general's office is located, and handed over a petition calling for the arrest of the suspects and the officers who allegedly failed to prosecute them. The petition, which was started online, was signed by more than 1,200,000 people from around the world. Saida Ali, executive director of the Coalition on Violence Against Women (COVAW) rights group, was among the protesters who handed the petition to police on Thursday. \"The response was polite, they promised to take action, so we will wait to see that action,\" she said. The girl, who is called Liz to protect her identity, is being cared for at the Gynocare Centre in Eldoret, 156km (97 miles) from Busia. Her mother is staying with her at the hospital. I briefly saw Liz, who answered my greeting in Swahili, the main language in Kenya, but the rest of the time she just stared, showing no emotion. We were told that this is an improvement and that last week she had refused to look any of her visitors in the eye. The Nation Media Group, a Kenya-based media house which first reported the story, has paid the medical bills for Liz amounting to more than $7,000 (Â£4,300). Their reporter named her Liz and that is how the world now knows her. Her mother said that since the online campaign began some people had even set up an education fund for Liz. But her medical condition is still of concern. She suffered fistula because of the rape - a condition where she lost control of the flow of urine and stool. The programme manager at the hospital, Jared Momanyi, said she had undergone surgery to correct the fistula. \"She was also traumatised but has been receiving counselling and she is improving,\" he added. She also injured her spine when she was thrown down the pit latrine and has been unable to walk for some time. Since the matter went public, and viral, the mother says some family members of the suspects have been threatening her. \"They said that if their sons are arrested I'll see fire,\" she said. Earlier her husband had to endure insults from a father of one suspect, who had initially offered to help the family, and then rescinded his decision. \"I want the suspects to be arrested and justice to be done. Up to now no-one has been arrested. I hear some have gone into hiding,\" Liz's mother said. The inspector general of police confirmed that the suspects could not be traced, adding that they had fled into Uganda. Busia - where the incident took place - is near the Kenya-Uganda border. The Director of Public Prosecution, Keriako Tobiko, has ordered their arrests but none has been made so far. However, Mr Tobiko confirmed to the BBC that he had received the investigations file from the police and was going through it. \"I will press charges once I find sufficient evidence,\" he said. The Sexual Offences Act of 2006 spells out tough punitive measures against people convicted of various sexual crimes. The Act empowers the court to issue a sentence of not less than 15 years for a conviction of gang rape, but the court may extend the sentence to imprisonment for life. The police in June released a report showing that reported cases of rape had increased to 383 between January and May this year, from 332 for the same period last year. Police stations in Kenya are expected to have a gender desk where such cases are reported.

Will hosts England survive the so-called 'group of death'? Former internationals from the home nations - Jeremy Guscott and Paul Grayson (England), Jonathan Davies and Robert Jones (Wales), Gavin Hastings and Mike Blair (Scotland), plus Stephen Ferris and Denis Hickie (Ireland) - are joined by southern hemisphere stars such as ex-All Black Andrew Mehrtens and Bobby Skinstad (South Africa) to tackle the big questions. Jeremy Guscott: \"Host nations invariably do well. Statistically they've always made the knockout stages and three times they've won it, albeit New Zealand have done it twice. South Africa in 1995 were the other home winners. On that basis alone, England should do well.\" Jonathan Davies: \"All the pundits have favoured Australia and England to get out of Pool A, but on their day Wales can beat anyone. Yes, we are third favourites but I still think Wales can shock one of those two and hopefully get through the group.\" Gavin Hastings: \"Realistically, getting out of the pool would be a good tournament. Scotland are a bit of an unknown quantity but they seem fit and strong and have a core of good players. South Africa will find it tough to play against Scotland, and we are capable of beating Samoa to get out of the group. I hope we play England in the quarter-finals at Twickenham!\" Stephen Ferris: \"Ireland can definitely get to a semi-final, which would be an achievement in itself. But we need to up the physicality from our recent games.\" Robert Jones: \"Wales are still a threat despite the injuries. Liam Williams needs match practice but he is probably a more creative attacking threat than Leigh Halfpenny, and Dan Biggar is almost as good a kicker and has grown into a fantastic player. As long as we stay injury free now to the end of the pool stage, I think we still have a chance.\" Mike Blair: \"Scotland will make the quarter-finals but they will need to play well to get there as it's not just about South Africa and Samoa in Pool B. Japan and USA will be very competitive too.\" Andrew Mehrtens: \"Most players around the world would say they would like to beat the All Blacks more than any other team, so the All Blacks have that pressure and weight of history. Every team lifts themselves when they play them, because it is the biggest game of their lives.\" Bobby Skinstad: \"The Springboks are probably slightly under-cooked, with half a dozen players coming back from injury. They are possibly not quite at their best yet, but I think that helps them. The selection has remained consistent and they have leaders with huge character.\" Denis Hickie: \"Momentum is key. Ireland have to beat Canada well in their first game and build into it because everyone thinks it will come down to the France game. Ireland have won two and drawn two of their last four against them, so there is confidence based on what has happened in the Six Nations. The flip side is Ireland have lost all three games against France at World Cups.\" Paul Grayson: \"With a bit of luck, England can win it.\" JG: \"Yes. They won't be fully tested until the quarter-finals or potentially the semis, if they make it that far, so they will be vulnerable when they face their first real test.\" JD: \"The winner of Pool A will go to the final. Australia are looking very good and England will have home advantage if they go through. But for me it's still New Zealand.\" AM: \"Australia are on the rise. They beat the All Blacks pretty comprehensively in Sydney and have a good team culture. The coach Michael Cheika is earthy and passionate; he is a hard taskmaster but the players seem to love him. They are coming in with some real momentum and have some stars in their backline.  If they get enough ball, they can go very well.\" MB: \"Yes. I believe that on their day England and South Africa could beat them, but the All Blacks are the strong favourites.\" SF: \"If you gave me money to put a bet on, I would put it on New Zealand. But I think the five or six usual suspects all have a genuine chance at winning the tournament and I would include England in that, even though I think it could go the other way with them perhaps not even making it out of their group. \"I really like South Africa's chances - the pack is so strong and rugby nowadays is all about the three Ps - pace, power, physicality.\" JG: \"Argentina have the potential to surprise France or Ireland in the quarter-finals - just ask South Africa, who the Pumas beat in the Rugby Championship.\" JD: \"Scotland will be the surprise package in their group and will go through. France will surprise Ireland.\" GH: \"Ireland, within themselves, will feel they are good enough to win this World Cup, and anything less than that, amongst the team, will be a failure. Not having got to a semi-final before doesn't make any difference to this current side. I think Ireland are capable of doing it.\" MB: \"It won't be a surprise as such but I think Ireland will have a strong tournament and will push the big guns along the way. It's crucial for them that they top their group, though, to avoid New Zealand in the quarter-finals.\" SF: \"Many people are writing Ireland off after their recent couple of lacklustre performances but I expect us to surprise a few people and to get back to the kind of form we have produced in the last two Six Nations and reach the semi-finals.\" JD: \"Unfortunately for Wales, I think it's going to be Israel Folau. The Australia full-back is a class act. He is an amazing player who can cause damage against anyone. Depending on how far Australia go, he could be the player of the tournament.\" Media playback is not supported on this device PG: \"When you have been the best in the world, you get to almost write your own scripts, and Dan Carter is the sort of guy who if New Zealand go well, he can elevate himself to the point where he could be sensational.\" BS: \"Israel Folau is probably the number one convert from rugby league with the athleticism he brings. He is just devastating on the counter-attack.\" AM:  \"All Blacks scrum-half Aaron Smith. The speed of his pass dictates the tempo of New Zealand's game and gives Dan Carter the time and space to operate. Even if the defence has numbers, it means they are always on the back foot.\" MB: \"New Zealand's Nehe Milner-Skudder is incredible. His footwork and offloads are ridiculous. England wing Jonny May is looking electric too and, given space, he will do damage.\" JG: \"Australia full-back Israel Folau, New Zealand full-back Ben Smith and England fly-half George Ford and outside centre Jonathan Joseph.\" SF: \"I am convinced that my former Ulster team-mate Iain Henderson is going to be one of the real stars of the tournament. South Africa's Duane Vermeulen will have a tremendous tournament and you can't expect anything other than Richie McCaw to round off a magnificent career by producing his usual brilliance for New Zealand and probably leading them to another World Cup triumph.\" JG: \"Home advantage gives England a big edge. In addition, if Australia, Wales and England all beat each other, they will know what result they have to achieve in their last match against Uruguay.\" JD: \"If you're looking at it as a betting man, Australia and England are the two to get out of Pool A. Despite the setbacks with injuries, I still think Wales can shock one of those two and hopefully get through the group.\" MB: \"Yes. With home advantage, a strong squad and a couple of injuries to the Welsh squad, I think they will advance.\" SF: \"That's a tough one and I can see it going either way for England.

Anti-immigrant, populist parties threaten the political status quo across the continent. EU leaders will tread warily today. They'll phrase their public statements very carefully. There will be expressions of outrage at the human traffickers who put people on the boats in the first place, and an emphasis on the EU helping people caught in war zones, by supporting UN efforts at conflict resolution and government-building. Underlying this though is a drive to stop people trying to enter Europe in their hundreds of thousands. But while trying to diminish the pull factor, EU leaders have to be realistic about the powerful push factor, driving people to seek a better life.

{"article": "Former House of Lords leader Lord Strathclyde came up with a proposal to remove peers' veto over laws - called statutory instruments - after a series of government defeats last year. The government said it now had \"no plans\" for legislation on the issue. But it warned peers it could reconsider unless they showed \"discipline and self regulation\". The government announced its review into the workings of Parliament last year after defeats in the House of Lords over controversial tax credit cuts. Labour said the original plan had been an \"absurd overreaction\". In a statement to peers, Baroness Evans, the leader of the House of Lords, said the will of elected MPs should prevail where there was a clash between the House of Commons and the House of Lords over a statutory instrument. But she added: \"We do not believe that we need to introduce primary legislation at this time.\" Unlike with regular legislation, there is not currently a mechanism to assert the Commons' primacy on statutory instruments, so the government relies on the \"discipline and self regulation that this House imposes on itself\", she said. \"Should that break down we would have to reflect on this decision.\" There have been claims the Lords could delay or block Brexit legislation, and Baroness Evans said when such laws are debated, \"the constructive approach that this House has so far shown will be ever more important\". There are several reasons why the Strathclyde proposals are now never likely to see the light of day. First, as if it needs saying, the political circumstances are transformed from this time last year. The government is trying not to fall into a black hole of Brexit, so some of the priorities of the previous administration that might have caused trouble in Parliament are being ditched. Second, Theresa May is a pragmatist. These plans were deeply controversial, described as the Labour Lords leader as an \"absurd overreaction\", and themselves might have struggled to get through Parliament. And third, sources have suggested that the government seems to want to rebuild a more traditional relationship with the Lords, dial down the confrontations and work more constructively together. Read more from Laura The change of heart is another policy planned by former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne that Theresa May's government is abandoning. One source said the reform had now \"been dumped\". Another added: \"The world has changed.\" It has been suggested to the BBC that the change is part of No 10 distancing itself from the previous administration, and part of its desire to pare back any legislation that might be controversial as the government prepares to face resistance in Parliament over its plans for leaving the EU. Lord Strathclyde told the BBC it would be sensible if the government could find a way of working more effectively with opposition parties in the Lords without having to change the law, saying:  \"Legislation should be a last resort.\" Baroness Smith, Labour's leader in the Lords, said she welcomed the government's realisation that \"the Strathclyde review was an absurd overreaction to a sensible and principled challenge on tax credits\". Crossbench peer Lord Digby Jones said the move was a \"big mistake\" and risked peers blocking Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I would have stuck to my guns because I think they're going to live to regret it on all of the Brexit stuff coming down the pipe.\" But the Electoral Reform Society described the Strathclyde proposals as a \"knee-jerk reaction to a government defeat\", calling instead for \"genuine Lords reform\".", "question": "The government has decided against a new law to curb the @placeholder of the House of Lords to block legislation .", "option_0": "resources", "option_1": "tendency", "option_2": "powers", "option_3": "end", "option_4": "attempts", "label": 2}

{"article": "The Welsh Government-sponsored review recommends stripping the body of most of its responsibilities and is strongly critical of management and governance. Chairman Prof Damian Walford Davies told BBC Wales the review's conclusions had stunned staff at Literature Wales. The review panel said it would be premature to comment with the recommendations still being considered. Literature Wales was created in 2011 to promote and develop reading and writing and had an income of about Â£1.2m last year. Prof Davies said: \"When the report was published we were dismayed, we were shocked, we were outraged by the dud that this report is. By its inaccuracies, by its under-par research into the field.\" Conclusions of the review, written by Prof Medwin Hughes, have also been criticised by the Arts Council of Wales, which funds the Cardiff-based Literature Wales. When the report was published last month, the Economy Secretary Ken Skates said he was \"minded\" to accept its recommendations. But Prof Davies said Mr Skates had since invited Literature Wales to submit a response to the review's conclusions. \"We met with the cabinet secretary [Ken Skates] and said that we needed a right of reply,\" he said. \"We needed not only the opportunity to put our case forward, but to correct the misrepresentations, the absences and the inaccuracies of the report. \"The cabinet secretary invited us to submit a full dossier of those concerns and those corrections. We have done so. That document runs to something like 5,000 words. \"That contains not only those corrections, not only counter-arguments, but documentary proof and analysis.

The review recommends that Welsh Government: Mr Skates, who is considering the review's findings, declined to be interviewed. Prof Davies said the evidence it had recently submitted to Mr Skates provided \"context\" that would correct a lack of evidence for its conclusions. \"It is my fervent belief that those wider contexts make this report's recommendations seem what they are.

{"article": "Robbie Keane poked in his 60th international goal in the 21st minute after a bright start from the hosts. But Johan Elmander headed a brilliant equaliser 12 minutes later as the Swedes began to take control. And with Zlatan Ibrahimovic dictating play, veteran Anders Svensson stroked in the winner on 57 minutes. The result means the Republic need to win in Austria on Tuesday and away to Germany next month to maintain any faint hopes of qualification, with a further home game against Kazakhstan to follow. Friday's result will inevitably lead to further criticism of Republic manager Giovanni Trapattoni and increase the prospects of him losing his job at the end of the current qualifying campaign. The match kicked off with both sides knowing defeat would leave them with an uphill struggle to clinch a play-off place behind runaway group leaders Germany. The Republic looked the more lively and purposeful outfit in the early stages, with Sweden centre-back Martin Olsson having to make a brave block to deny a goalbound Shane Long shot in the second minute. 10 September: Austria (a) 11 October: Germany (a) 15 October: Kazakhstan (h) The Swedish defence appeared vulnerable under the high ball with Glenn Whelan firing straight at keeper Andreas Isaksson in the eighth minute and Jonathan Walters then off target after a crunching challenge from John O'Shea on dangerman Ibrahimovic. At the other end, Marc Wilson made up for misjudging the flight of a deep cross as he reacted brilliantly to block an angled Ibrahimovic shot in the 16th minute. However, the Republic were continuing to look the busier and gave the visitors a scare on 20 minutes as an attempted cross from James McClean bounced on Isaksson's crossbar. The home team's enterprise was rewarded within a minute as Keane's chased down a weak Mikael Lustig back header and scrambled home after his initial poked shot hit the post. But that was as good as it got for the Irish as they quickly surrendered the initiative. Elmander had a chance to level within two minutes but scuffed his shot into David Forde's arms after hesitation in the Irish defence. Full qualifying tables On the half-hour, the unmarked Sebastian Larsson missed a glorious chance to level as he somehow headed wide from six yards after a beautifully weighted cross from Ibrahimovic. But the equaliser did come three minutes later as Lustig's brilliant right-wing cross was glanced home by Elmander after the Norwich striker got in ahead of Richard Dunne. McClean tested Isaksson six minutes into the second half but the Swedes, with Ibrahimovic controlling the game, were looking the more threatening. Forde had to race from his line on 55 minutes to dive at Larsson's feet after Ibrahimovic split the Irish defence with another superb pass. But Forde's efforts were to count for little when, seconds later, Ibrahimovic passed for 37-year-old Svensson to run through and fire past the keeper on the night he won his national-record equalling 143rd cap. In the closing stages, their was little shape to the Republic team, with recent Everton signing James McCarthy struggling to make any impression on the contest. Trapattoni opted not to send on the creative talents of Wes Hoolahan in the closing stages instead opting to give an international debut to the midfielder's Norwich club-mate Anthony Pilkington while Simon Cox was also introduced to little effect. Long did managed to find a couple of promising positions but was unable to pick out an attacking colleague as the visitors ran out victorious.

{"article": "There are those who will argue to kingdom come that the Six Nations is fine as it is, that it has its own identity and doesn't need to go down the road of being tricked up. What next? Kiss-cams. Mexican waves. Pitch-side microphone-wielding fun police ordering everybody to 'MAKE SOME NOISE!' Too late, alas. Too late. Those who are against bonus points for extra scores see it is a gimmick that will do nothing to enhance a tournament that doesn't need a whole lot of enhancing in the first place. Apply a retrospective bonus-point system and would it have changed the finishing order in 2016? No. How about 2015, 2014? No, no. Are there not enough tries in the Six Nations already? Not as many as its southern hemisphere counterpart, the Rugby Championship, but enough to satisfy the vast crowds who always turn up to watch it? The average try count per match in the 2016 Six Nations was 4.73. In the Rugby Championship it was 5.83. The season before it was 4.13 in the north and 5.5 in the south. The season before that, 4.07 in the Six Nations and 4.17 in the Rugby Championship. It's not as big a gulf as people might think. In any event, Six Nations rugby is not Rugby Championship rugby. It has its own heartbeat. Oftentimes, it's rugby in the trenches. Full Metal Jacket stuff. It's not as easy on the eye as the New Zealands and the Australias, but it works. And fans adore it. In the southern hemisphere's four-nation tournament, yes, there are more tries, but does that necessarily make it better, more intoxicating? Across a difficult four-year period in economic terms, Six Nations crowds have gone from an average of 69,531 to 68,968, a drop of less than 1%. That's good going in the climate. The Rugby Championship's crowds are down close to 12%. The opposing, pro-change view is that the Six Nations has become a bit tired and is in need of modernising. The Rugby Championship, the Champions Cup, the Premiership in England, the Pro12, the Top 14 in France and Super Rugby in the southern hemisphere all have the bonus-point system. In the Six Nations there is a view that the premium is on defence over attack. That argument can be overblown, but there's truth in it, too. Those who are supportive of the new bonus-point system see a vision of the future that will have a nation busting a gut to turn three tries into four in the latter stages of a Test, just to secure that extra point. Cue more attacking intent and more entertainment. That's the wish. For example, in the 2015 Six Nations, had England scored four tries against Scotland - and got a bonus point - instead of three they might have won the championship. The winners, Ireland, could apply the same logic to one of their games, of course. So could Wales. In 2014, had England added to their two first-half tries in their victory against Wales with another two in the second half they might have won that championship, too. They didn't. Ireland did - and it was hard-won and richly deserved. The final Saturday of both of those Six Nations were thrill-fests. Ireland secured the title with a hugely dramatic victory in Paris in 2014 and they won it again in 2015 with that most incredible trilogy where tries cascaded down on Ireland in Scotland, Wales in Italy and England against France. Three nations were in a mad-dash for the winning line. It was an utterly brilliant day, so why would you want to mess with the dynamic? There is no harm in tinkering. Experimentation is to be applauded, just as long as there's an open mind and that if bonus points are not seen to be working then they're put in the bin and the Six Nations is restored to its old, flawed, but thoroughly loveable self.", "question": "When the Six Nations committee decided to introduce a bonus - point system for the 2017 championship you could almost hear the @placeholder reactions in rugby heartlands in Britain and Ireland .", "option_0": "preferred", "option_1": "power", "option_2": "contrasting", "option_3": "affect", "option_4": "defining", "label": 2}
{"article": "Most people can readily conjure images inside their head - known as their mind's eye. But this year scientists have described a condition, aphantasia, in which some people are unable to visualise mental images. Niel Kenmuir, from Lancaster, has always had a blind mind's eye. He knew he was different even in childhood. \"My stepfather, when I couldn't sleep, told me to count sheep, and he explained what he meant, I tried to do it and I couldn't,\" he says. \"I couldn't see any sheep jumping over fences, there was nothing to count.\" Our memories are often tied up in images, think back to a wedding or first day at school. As a result, Niel admits, some aspects of his memory are \"terrible\", but he is very good at remembering facts. And, like others with aphantasia, he struggles to recognise faces. Yet he does not see aphantasia as a disability, but simply a different way of experiencing life. It is impossible to see what someone else is picturing inside their head. Psychologists use the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, which asks you to rate different mental images, to test the strength of the mind's eye. The University of Exeter has developed an abridged version that lets you see how your mind compares. Try our version of the aphantasia test here Ironically, Niel now works in a bookshop, although he largely sticks to the non-fiction aisles. His condition begs the question what is going on inside his picture-less mind. I asked him what happens when he tries to picture his fiancee. \"This is the hardest thing to describe, what happens in my head when I think about things,\" he says. \"When I think about my fiancee there is no image, but I am definitely thinking about her, I know today she has her hair up at the back, she's brunette. \"But I'm not describing an image I am looking at, I'm remembering features about her, that's the strangest thing and maybe that is a source of some regret.\" The response from his mates is a very sympathetic: \"You're weird.\" But while Niel is very relaxed about his inability to picture things, it is a cause of distress for others. One person who took part in a study into aphantasia said he had started to feel \"isolated\" and \"alone\" after discovering that other people could see images in their heads. Being unable to reminisce about his mother years after her death led to him being \"extremely distraught\". At the other end of the spectrum is children's book illustrator, Lauren Beard, whose work on the Fairytale Hairdresser series will be familiar to many six-year-olds. Her career relies on the vivid images that leap into her mind's eye when she reads text from her author. When I met her in her box-room studio in Manchester, she was working on a dramatic scene in the next book. The text describes a baby perilously climbing onto a chandelier. \"Straightaway I can visualise this grand glass chandelier in some sort of French kind of ballroom, and the little baby just swinging off it and really heavy thick curtains,\" she says. \"I think I have a strong imagination, so I can create the world and then keep adding to it so it gets sort of bigger and bigger in my mind and the characters too they sort of evolve. \"I couldn't really imagine what it's like to not imagine, I think it must be a bit of a shame really.\" Not many people have mental imagery as vibrant as Lauren or as blank as Niel. They are the two extremes of visualisation. Adam Zeman, a professor of cognitive and behavioural neurology, wants to compare the lives and experiences of people with aphantasia and its polar-opposite hyperphantasia. His team, based at the University of Exeter, coined the term aphantasia this year in a study in the journal Cortex. Prof Zeman tells the BBC: \"People who have contacted us say they are really delighted that this has been recognised and has been given a name, because they have been trying to explain to people for years that there is this oddity that they find hard to convey to others.\" How we imagine is clearly very subjective - one person's vivid scene could be another's grainy picture. But Prof Zeman is certain that aphantasia is real. People often report being able to dream in pictures, and there have been reported cases of people losing the ability to think in images after a brain injury. He is adamant that aphantasia is \"not a disorder\" and says it may affect up to one in 50 people. But he adds: \"I think it makes quite an important difference to their experience of life because many of us spend our lives with imagery hovering somewhere in the mind's eye which we inspect from time to time, it's a variability of human experience.\" If you think you have aphantasia or hyperphantasia and would like to be involved in Prof Zeman's research he is happy to be contacted at a.zeman@exeter.ac.uk", "question": "Close your eyes and imagine walking along a sandy beach and then @placeholder over the horizon as the Sun rises .

{"article": "If the latest ceasefire in eastern Ukraine breaks down, then there will be increased pressure on President Barack Obama by hawks in Washington - Democrat as well as Republican - to provide arms to Ukraine, and on European leaders to acquiesce in this. In the view of a range of analysts and former officials on both sides of the Atlantic, this seems a singularly ill-thought out strategy. More importantly, the advocates of arming Ukraine do not appear either to have sufficiently analysed the actual balance of forces on the ground, or to have studied a key lesson from recent history: namely, what happened to Georgia when its government launched an offensive against separatist rebels and their Russian backers in South Ossetia in August 2008. After brief initial gains, the Georgian army was crushed by new Russian forces. This apparently lunatic Georgian move is only comprehensible if President Mikheil Saakashvili believed that the USA would intervene militarily to prevent Georgia's defeat. Of course it did not, nor had any such promise ever been made by the Bush administration. But the Georgians could have been forgiven for not realising that, given that they had received weapons, extravagant political support, and a promise of future Nato membership from Washington. What happened in Georgia? Against the background of this history, it cannot be emphasised too strongly that, for the foreseeable future, however many weapons the Ukrainian army receives from the USA, if it gets into an open fight with the Russian army, it is likely to lose, and lose catastrophically. So far, very limited numbers of lightly disguised Russian troops have been enough to bring to a standstill the entire fighting strength of the Ukrainian army - last autumn, the Nato estimate was that a mere 3,000 Russian soldiers were present in the Donbas. With massive US arms supplies, the Ukrainian army might well be able to launch an initially successful offensive against these forces and their local separatist allies. But what then? All the evidence suggests that the Russian government simply cannot afford the humiliation of a Ukrainian military victory. In other words, as in August 2008 in Georgia, Moscow would respond with greatly increased military force. In the highly unlikely event that the USA then sent its own troops to help Ukraine - which has already been repeatedly ruled out - we would be in a European war between nuclear powers. If it did not, the Ukrainian army would risk the high probability of defeat, and if so, the USA and Nato would be severely humiliated. In August 2008, after smashing the Georgian army, Russia briefly occupied parts of Georgia proper - beyond the borders of the separatist territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia - and then withdrew. Since neither Russia nor the separatists had any historical or ethnic claim on these strategically worthless Georgian territories, there was no reason for them to stay. Russian attitudes to eastern and southern Ukraine are very different. If the Russian army ever marches into Kharkov and Dnipropetrovsk, they are very likely to stay. Ukraine can survive without Donetsk, Lugansk and the Crimea. Indeed, it could be seen as a stronger and more homogenous state without them, as the election of President Petro Poroshenko demonstrated. The loss of a third of the country would be a very different matter. The partition of Ukraine would indeed mark a return to the Cold War, implying vastly increased European military spending, and colossally increased aid to Ukraine intended to prepare the country for early membership of the European Union - something for which the EU is utterly unprepared. The duty of Western leaders therefore is to try to make sure that the present ceasefire works. Despite the battle for Debaltseve, there is some chance that it may work - or at least, a better chance than that of previous attempts. This is above all because it includes a critical element missing from those attempts: a political solution tied to a specific timetable, and one which allows all the main parties to the conflict to achieve their most important goal (with the possible exception of the separatist leadership in the Donbas). Concurrently with the withdrawal of heavy weapons, dialogue is to begin on holding local elections in the rebel territories, in accordance with the Ukrainian law on provisional autonomy for the region. The Ukrainian parliament has to pass a resolution on this within 30 days of the ceasefire. By the end of 2015, Ukraine is to regain full control of its borders in the east; but also by the end of 2015, a new Ukrainian federal constitution has to be adopted incorporating special autonomous status for the Donbas. In the meantime, the government in Kiev will reopen economic ties with the Donbas and resume paying official salaries in the region - thereby helping in the process of reintegrating it into Ukraine. For Kiev and Western governments, this agreement secures their most important goal of preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, minus Crimea, with a central government which preserves the ability to conduct desperately needed reforms. This is a goal which could otherwise only be achieved through victorious war - and whatever hawks in the USA may think, any full-scale war between Ukraine and Russia will almost certainly result not in Ukrainian victory, but in a crushing Ukrainian defeat and the further dismemberment of the country. Moreover, trying to turn Ukraine into a country capable of planning such a war would require a degree of authoritarian nationalism which would move Ukraine not closer to the European Union, but even further away from it. For Russia, this deal preserves the Donbas as a distinct autonomous area within Ukraine. A federal constitution would also help guarantee the position of Russian-speaking areas of the country against any move to forced ukrainianisation from Kiev. From Moscow's point of view, this would also make it much more difficult to move Ukraine into the West's military camp without a strong consensus behind this in Ukrainian society - a consensus which was present in central European countries during their move to join Nato, but which has never existed in Ukraine. This is the main sticking point as far as hardliners in both Ukraine and the US are concerned: that the present deal will make Ukraine's membership in Nato and the EU impossible. In actual fact, however, these are non-issues. By repeatedly stating that under no circumstances will Nato troops be sent to defend Ukraine, Nato seems to have rendered the idea of Ukrainian membership an unlikely prospect. As for EU membership, it's unlikely any West European leader has ever considered this as more than the remotest of prospects, decades in the future and dependent on a whole series of extremely long and painful changes. This is a decision therefore which would in all circumstances have to be left to a future generation. Moreover, given the economic reality of Ukrainian economic dependence on Russia, salvaging Ukraine's collapsing economy can only be done in co-operation with Russia, not against her. Unless, that is, the EU is prepared to demand from West European populations enormous sacrifices for the sake of helping Ukraine. Anyone who believes that is likely should have a brief conversation with a Greek. For the ceasefire to hold and a political solution to be reached, the governments of France and Germany will have to show an unwonted degree of resolve and toughness over the next year. On the one hand, they will have to make clear to Moscow that the relaxations of sanctions against Russia will only come as a result of clear and consistent pressure on the Donbas rebels to abide by the terms of the ceasefire and to pursue autonomy within Ukraine, and not independence. On the other hand, they will need to make clear to the Ukrainian government and to hardliners in Washington that significant EU aid to Ukraine, and an eventual path to possible EU membership, both depend on Kiev honouring the promise of real autonomy for the Donbas. The present ceasefire and the associated political process are not perfect, but they present the best chance so far of ending this conflict, preserving by far the greater part of Ukraine as a unitary state, and avoiding an escalation of the war that would most probably be very bad for Russia and the West, and absolutely disastrous for Ukraine.

A week before the final Harry Potter novel was due to be published in 2007, all 759 pages were leaked online. Images of all the pages along with a transcript appeared on a number of websites, while bloggers angered fans by writing lists of all the characters who died in the book. US publisher Scholastic also sued two companies for dispatching copies of the book four days early, some of which ended up on eBay. The film version of the book also suffered a leak when a 36-minute clip of the movie was illegally posted on file-sharing websites days before its cinema release. Last year, the Doctor found himself at the centre of two leaks. In July, five scripts for the eighth series were posted online - seven weeks before the episodes were due to be broadcast. A week later footage featuring the new Doctor - Peter Capaldi - appeared on the internet, although it was in black and white and missing special effects. BBC Worldwide said the leak originated from an office in the US and disciplinary action was taken. An almost finished copy of X-Men Origins: Wolverine was uploaded to several file sharing websites a month before its cinema release in 2009. Although it was a high quality copy, some special effects were incomplete and green screens and wires attached to actors were still visible. Its star Hugh Jackman said he was \"heartbroken\" over the leak, which the FBI was called in to investigate. A New York man was sentenced to a year in federal prison in 2011 for uploading the film on two websites. An early version of the script for the upcoming Bond film was stolen by hackers as part of the cyber attack on Sony Pictures last November. As well as the script, copious notes from executives were included about improving the film's ending, which MGM's Jonathan Glickman said was \"a let down on climax\". The film is still in production and is due in cinemas in November. The first episode of the third series of hit US anti-terror show was leaked almost a month before it was due to be broadcast in 2013. More than 100,000 BitTorrent users pirated the episode within hours of it being uploaded. Although preview copies were distributed to press, the leaked episode was unfinished and missing visual effects and the opening credits. The most recent high profile leak occurred in April when the first four episodes of Game of Thrones' fifth season were put online a day before its official broadcast - nearly half of the 10 total episodes.

The Adjudication Panel for Wales has been asked to comment. Mr Clubb said the clash \"could lead to an erosion in public trust\" in the work of the panel. Mr McEvoy, a Plaid AM for South Wales Central and the party's group leader on Cardiff council, is facing a tribunal over allegations he brought the authority into disrepute in his role as a local councillor. BBC Wales reported in January that the case, referred to the tribunal by the Ombudsman, apparently relates to whether a comment was made to a council officer in a threatening way. In a letter to the panel, Mr Clubb said the Fairwater councillor \"will be speaking at the conference and we would not wish his speech to be disturbed either by his appearance at a panel or by his having to prepare for an imminent hearing\". He said the case \"could have been heard at almost any point in November through February on a date that would not have conflicted with a critical date in the political calendar\". Mr Clubb, who has served as Plaid's chief executive since last September, said timetabling the hearing for the day of the conference gave the \"appearance of political interference, even if the date clash is entirely coincidental. \"I fear that scheduling Mr McEvoy's case to coincide with our spring conference fails this test and could lead to an erosion in public trust in the work of the panel.\" In the letter Mr Clubb suggests it could be seen \"that the panel is trying to unfairly prevent [Mr McEvoy's] appearance at conference\". He said an \"impartial decision\" would rightly determine that the \"proposed date is manifestly unfair to Mr McEvoy\". Mr Clubb, who said the dates of the conference had been public knowledge since November, called for the hearing date to be changed so it avoided the conference and the \"formal local election period\".

{"article": "The NASUWT survey claims some parents are asked for £400 or more per year. Schools in England have been warning of cash shortages and the union says schools are now depending on parents. But the Department for Education says \"no parent is required to make a contribution\". Teachers' unions are holding their conferences over the Easter bank holiday weekend, with funding one of the biggest issues. The National Union of Teachers, meeting in Cardiff, will hear warnings on Saturday about the impact of cash shortages. The survey from the NASUWT survey, holding its annual conference in Manchester, claims that schools are increasingly relying on money from parents. Based on almost 4,000 responses, the survey says 18% of parents have been asked to sign up for direct debits or standing orders for their children's school, typically of about £50 per year. But more than one in 20 parents with children in state schools were paying £400 or above. A further 13% of parents had been asked to make donations in cash or cheques. Your comments on schools asking parents to top up their budgets: \"She's only been there a term, but there seems to be a letter home at least once a week asking for money,\" a parent told the NASUWT survey. \"The school asks for a 'voluntary contribution' but if you forget to pay you are sent texts telling you that you haven't paid,\" said another parent. There were other financial costs for parents, such as a laptop for homework and music lessons. \"We have not allowed them to do music at school as they need to provide their own instruments,\" said a parent, quoted in the survey. Over a quarter of parents said their child had been unable to take part in a trip or excursion because of the cost. \"Ski trip was £600. French trip £450. These are for less than a week. They are beyond my funds,\" a parent told the survey. The union's leader Chris Keates said that \"access to education must not be based on parents' ability to pay\". This week the Sutton Trust education charity warned of schools cutting staff because of financial pressure. The Public Accounts Committee has said that standards are threatened by school budget cuts of £3bn. A lobby of Parliament over funding, by teachers' unions and parents' campaign groups, has been announced for early June. Kevin Courtney, NUT general secretary, reminded the government of a manifesto commitment to parents that \"the money that follows their children into schools will be protected\". \"In half of the schools in the country the money following your child into schools has been dramatically cut in cash terms, and in the other half it's been cut in real terms,\" he said. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"No parent is required to make a contribution to their child's education, the rules are clear on this and no policies have been introduced by this government to allow schools to charge parents.\" The spokeswoman said school funding was at record levels, but \"we recognise schools are facing cost pressures.\"", "question": "Almost one in five parents in the UK is being asked to @placeholder up payments to their children 's schools , as head teachers warn of budget shortages , says a survey from a teachers ' union .", "option_0": "hand", "option_1": "open", "option_2": "drum", "option_3": "pick", "option_4": "set", "label": 4}

At a briefing given by the Foreign Secretary William Hague and the Irish Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore, Channel Four's Gary Gibbon invited the politicians to share the interpretation that the joint appearance at the Garden was \"a moment of contrition\". However the ministers weren't going there - it was \"a hugely significant event\", full of \"huge symbolism\" and an \"important statement about our history and our future\". But \"contrition\"? Well that would be in the eye of the beholder. I asked the Foreign Secretary if it would be appropriate for the Queen to apologise for past British misdeeds in Ireland when she addresses guests at tomorrow night's state banquet. Mr Hague responded that Britain and Ireland weren't \"glossing over the past\". This visit was about recognising the events of the past and showing how both states were moving together into the future. \"That's the way to treat it rather than talking about apologies\", Mr Hague concluded. So - if that's anything to go by - expect a carefully crafted speech but something which stops short of a direct apology. Mr Hague also avoided any promises on issues like revealing official records on the Dublin Monaghan bombings. It's something he says he's prepared to discuss, but he cited legal difficulties and constraints under the European Convention on Human Rights. Both governments are much keener to talk about the future - the potential for further trade between partners who already do business worth one billion Euros a week. Eamon Gilmore went so far as to suggest that the visit will put not just the history of the troubles in the past, but show Ireland was moving on from its  \"recent economic history\" and rebuilding its reputation. Nice thought, although it's maybe a bit optimistic to talk about the crash as history just yet. Both governments will be pleased that the Gardai were able to contain the inevitable protests - and that the visit has made the requisite visual impact.

{"article": "On Thursday, we were summoned to Stormont Castle and presented with a list of initiatives. So how ambitious were they? A target date of 2023 for bringing down the peace walls and other barriers is certainly eye catching - although it would have come as more of a shock if the BBC had not obtained a draft of the 10-year plan back in January. I joked with one official that we should really headline Thursday night's story: \"Stormont delays removal of walls by a year.\" Despite that, it is refreshing to hear local ministers committing themselves to such an ambitious goal. In the past they have left it to visiting VIPs like the New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to tell them that a city divided by physical barriers sends out all the wrong messages to the world. Drawing up a target is easier than achieving it, and many of those who live in the shadow of the peace walls will - especially after the tensions over the union flag dispute - fear the potential consequences of any premature removal. But the direction of travel is hard to argue with. Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness's peace plan is definitely a decimal document. Ten years to bring down the walls, ten new shared educational campuses, ten new shared neighbourhoods, 100 summer camps and 10,000 placements for young people not in work, training or education. You can see why they didn't opt for 13 as the common denominator. Whether they achieve all the round numbers will be interesting to assess - one Alliance politician I bumped into claimed it was proving impossible to fill the training places for young people already on offer. But again, the aspiration appears laudable. Not so long ago a visiting foreign diplomat asked me why Stormont did not introduce a form of national service to promote citizenship amongst disaffected young people. I explained why differences over national identity and/or military service would make such an idea a non-starter. That said, the \"United Youth Programme\", with its emphasis on citizenship, sharing, work experience and volunteering sounds as close as Stormont could get. Along with an emphasis on cross community sports, few could reject the idea outright, although some might wonder how new such schemes are. Predictably other Stormont parties have given the DUP-Sinn Fein announcement a dusty response - the SDLP called it a rehash of the items previously under discussion as part of the Cohesion, Sharing and Integration (CSI) strategy. Alliance described it as a collection of \"one-off, back of the envelope initiatives\". But in a previous era, London and Dublin often came in for criticism when they sought to break deadlocks by putting their heads together then pushing forward with their best guess at a compromise everyone could live with. In the devolved era, the DUP and Sinn Fein find themselves playing a a slightly similar role, although the fact that they are dealing with their electoral opponents adds an extra edge to the cross-party discord. Will an independent chair be able to broker deals on flags, parades and the past when the previous Stormont working group has failed to reach a consensus? That will depend not only on the personality and experience of the individual, but also whether they are seen to have sufficient authority. Although the first and deputy first ministers argue there is no real connection, it is undeniable that Thursday's step forward followed pressure from the secretary of state and the prime minister, linking fresh economic support to the need for more progress on a shared future. The US government was quick to welcome the Stormont announcement. It may be that Washington, London and Dublin still have a role to play, either by putting their diplomatic weight behind whoever chairs the cross-party talks on flags, parades and the past or perhaps by contributing some much needed fresh ideas for how to go about cracking these hardest of hard nuts.", "question": "Northern Ireland 's first and deputy first ministers have been promising us ambitious plans on a shared future in recent weeks , but @placeholder nothing in the way of detail .", "option_0": "providing", "option_1": "reported", "option_2": "declared", "option_3": "garnered", "option_4": "sparked", "label": 0}

She told me everyone in Bushmills knew about the fairies on the rock and that her brothers and sisters were actually a bit scared of them. Our archive report promoted a lots of readers to get in touch with their stories. One listener got in touch with BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme to let us know about a fairy thorn that was growing at Ormeau Golf Club. Denis McKnight, who is the secretary of the club, said it has been there longer than anyone can remember. \"The club was opened in 1893 so it's at least 122 years old and goes right back,\" he said. \"None of our green keepers will touch it or cut it down. They won't even trim it Mr McKnight said that balls had been lost in the tree and never seen again. \"If you hit the tree and don't apologise you're guaranteed to have a bad game,\" he said. \"When people visit the club we have to warn them about the fairy thorn. We tell them to nod to it as they go past and they have to apologise if they hit it.\" Although Denis is not aware of any members seeing any actual fairies, even after coming out of the clubhouse after a late night. He said the club used the thorn on their logo for a while and that they will never cut it down. \"It's far too important to us now to try and cut it down,\" he said.

{"article": "Crouching between a high rise estate and a busy dual carriageway, the slow-flowing river looks nondescript until it comes to a large caged concrete tunnel, thrusting under the city's ring road. This is the where the River Sherbourne, once vital for early settlers, disappears from view and becomes a hidden river: contained, covered and contaminated. Historians believe the river was much larger in Anglo-Saxon times and would have supplied fish and drinking water to small hamlets in the Forest of Arden, the forerunners to Coventry itself. Despite its current condition, classified by the Environment Agency as \"poor\" (or two out of five for quality), some believe the Sherbourne could be liquid gold for tourism in the regenerating city. The river, which disappeared into a culvert under city centre development in the 1960s, could be worth £1.5bn in flood action savings and increased property prices and business investment, according to a Defra-funded report by Aecom. The River Sherbourne makes a brief reappearance in the city centre, among the bins and back doors of shops behind Cross Cheaping, where its rotten smell, like damp decomposing cabbages, unmistakably rises from its murky flow. Aecom, whose research was commissioned by the government's technology strategy board, estimated it would cost about £3.3m to open up a central section of the river, making it visible to tourists and residents. \"By allowing green infrastructure to do a proper job in a city, you make it a nice place... and the buildings around rivers enjoy higher property values,\" said Michael Henderson, its associate director. The report identifies four places to uncover the river, saying it would attract people and business to the city centre, \"create excellent public realm and walking routes\" and improve the water quality of the light and oxygen-starved hidden water. Early maps show the river, which starts north west of the city near Corley, was steadily controlled and covered throughout the 20th Century, before the city's post-war rebuilding hid it almost completely. Colin Walker, from the Coventry Society, said: \"Coventry almost certainly owes its founding and development largely to the river. While we now dismiss it as not much more than a sewer, in medieval times it was a very useful tool. \"The six monasteries... all ran sheep and processing the wool made Coventry a very rich city.\" One of the society's other members, Paul Maddocks, champions the idea of opening up the city centre river and, in 1995, drew up a plan to present to the council. His idea was to use the river as a centrepiece in a pedestrian square and industrial heritage quarter, but he failed to win backing from councillors. Recently urban explorers have defied its danger signs and trespassed to explore the culverts, anonymously posting videos and blogging about \"cool stalagmites, pipes and waterfalls\". Artists have imagined the role of the river if uncovered again, as Julian Beever created a pavement chalk drawing illusion and Kathryn Hawkins drilled the river route in the concrete floor of a city shop. Miss Hawkins said: \"Coventry wouldn't be here if the river wasn't here. The ring road is a dominant image now, 45 years ago the river was still a dominant feature of the city centre. \"The ring road came into being and the river... ceased to be visible.\" Once free of the city, the Sherbourne joins the River Sowe near Baginton and eventually flows into the River Avon, which is well used for tourism in Warwickshire. Unlike its well-known cousin, the Sherbourne is too small to be navigable, but could still have a use in the regeneration of Coventry, depending on the future of the government funded research. Coventry City Council would not comment on the likelihood of the report schemes being realised, but the Coventry Society's Mr Maddocks said he remains hopeful. He said: \"The Sherbourne is the reason why Coventry started here around 700AD, then grew to be one of the most important Medieval cities in the country. \"Most towns and cities celebrate their river, hopefully we will too.\"", "question": "BBC News @placeholder the hidden River Sherbourne , covered by city centre development , that a report claims could be worth £ 1.5 bn for Coventry .", "option_0": "reached", "option_1": "revealed", "option_2": "nicknamed", "option_3": "follows", "option_4": "described", "label": 3}

{"article": "Most were unaware that it was exactly one year since the Glasgow bin lorry tragedy, but there were many who had remembered. They gathered around the fair in George Square, in darkness as a mark of respect, and the floral tributes outside the Gallery of Modern Art. They stood in silence to remember those who had been affected by the tragedy. A woman stood beside the road on Queen Street sobbing heavily, comforted by a companion. Another quietly sobbed as she looked at the floral tributes outside the Gallery of Modern Art. Many more stopped for a minute as they walked past the flowers to read the messages left with them. Some of the flowers had been left by friends and relatives who were affected by the tragedy but most were placed anonymously by members of the public. They served as a reminder for many of the shoppers and and city-centre workers who may otherwise have forgotten the tragedy's first anniversary. Several times today, passers-by questioned their companions about why the flowers had been laid. Some did not know, but when the bin lorry crash was referenced usually it was followed by a respectful silence. It was an overcast day in George Square, but the scene was brightened by a big bunch of yellow flowers. They were laid by two young colleagues of Erin McQuade, who was 18 when she died in the tragedy. The pair worked with her at Cameron House. As they laid the bunch of yellow flowers outside of the Gallery of Modern Art, one said: \"We picked these flowers because they were so bright and we thought it was a nice way to remember her on what is obviously a sad day. \"It has really affected all of her colleagues. Although we went to her funeral, we also had a night out to our local pub as a way of remembering her. \"She was genuinely the nicest person I have ever met - she was so funny.\" Another mourner, Jane McIntyre, said she did not know any of the victims, but she felt it was important to remember them and their families, especially because of the time of year. As she laid a bunch of roses, she said: \"I came last year with my daughter to lay flowers on Boxing Day, because all I could think about on Christmas Day when I was standing cutting my sprouts was that poor woman who lost her daughter and both of her parents. \"I've brought my daughter back today because I'll never, ever forget this day. It's just so sad. If that was me I don't think I'd ever be able to celebrate Christmas again.\" She laid her flowers next to those left by Glasgow's Lord Provost Sadie Docherty.

{"article": "The actress may not be a familiar name to British audiences, but she is better known in the US for her role as Rachel Zane in TV drama Suits. Markle was born on 4 August 1981 and grew up in Los Angeles but now lives in Toronto. She studied at a girls' Roman Catholic college before graduating from Northwestern University School of Communication in 2003, just as her acting career was beginning. Between auditions, she has told of making money by doing calligraphy for wedding invitations, using skills developed in handwriting classes at school. Her father was a TV lighting director and her first television appearance in the US was in an episode of the medical drama General Hospital in 2002, before moving on to roles in CSI, Without A Trace and Castle. Markle then began appearing in major Hollywood films, including Get Him To The Greek, Remember Me and Horrible Bosses. She has also appeared in the sci-fi series Fringe, playing FBI special agent Amy Jessup, and is perhaps most famous for her role in Suits, which is shown on the Dave channel and Netflix in the UK. In September 2011, she married film producer Trevor Engelson after dating for seven years, but the pair divorced two years later. Markle is also the editor-in-chief of her lifestyle website and brand The Tig, which covers food, beauty, fashion and travel. She said setting up the website was an attempt to \"reframe the beauty content to include think pieces about self-empowerment\" and feature dynamic, inspirational women. In a post on The Tig, she explained: \"I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works.\" She has also grown a large social network following, with 1.1 million people following her posts on Instagram and over 330,000 Twitter followers. Earlier this year, Markle became the Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada, which campaigns for better education, food and healthcare for children around the world. As part of her role, the actress travelled to Rwanda for the charity's Clean Water Campaign. As well as her humanitarian work, she is known for campaigning for gender equality. Aged 11, she forced a soap manufacturer to alter an advert after she wrote a letter to then First Lady Hillary Clinton and other high-profile figures complaining that it implied women belonged in the kitchen. Markle's commitment to gender equality has seen her work with the United Nations, and she received a standing ovation from an audience including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for a speech she made on International Women's Day 2015. Commenting on how she combines acting with her humanitarian commitments, she said: \"While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, co-exist. And for me, they must.\" Markle, whose father is white and mother is African American, wrote an article for Elle magazine last year about her racial heritage. She wrote: \"While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. \"To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.\" Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.", "question": "Prince Harry has confirmed actress Meghan Markle is his girlfriend in a @placeholder from Kensington Palace .

{"article": "The annual inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose to 0.6% in July from 0.5% in June, the Office for National Statistics said. More expensive alcoholic drinks and hotel rooms also helped to increase the CPI rate, the ONS said. The Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation rose to 1.9% in July from 1.6% in June. July's RPI inflation rate sets the cap for how much regulated rail fares in England, Scotland and Wales can rise by next year. Separate figures from the ONS suggested that the fall in the value of the pound since the UK's referendum vote to leave the EU had increased the cost of imports for manufacturers. Input prices faced by manufacturers rose 4.3% in the year to July, compared with a fall of 0.5% in the year to June. The most dramatic rises came in the cost of imported food materials, which rose 10.2%, and the price of imported metals, which rose 12.4%. In addition, the prices of finished goods leaving the factory gate were 0.3% higher than a year earlier, the first annual increase since June 2014. \"There is no obvious impact on today's consumer prices figures following the EU referendum result, though the Producer Prices Index (PPI) suggests the fall in the exchange rate is beginning to push up import price faced by manufacturers,\" said Mike Prestwood, head of prices at the ONS. However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the fall in sterling was \"entirely responsible\" for the rise in CPI inflation to the highest rate since November 2014. Against the dollar, the pound is some 13% below its level in the run-up to the referendum and 10% lower against the euro. \"Sterling's depreciation ensured that pump prices rose by 0.7% month-to-month even though dollar oil prices declined,\" he said. \"As a result, we continue to think that CPI inflation will hit 3% in the second half of 2017.\" As prices for companies rise, the pressure to keep down costs may be bad for wages, according to Howard Archer, chief UK and european economist at IHS Global Insight. He said: \"Companies may well look to clamp down on workers' pay as they strive to save costs in a more difficult environment and as imported input prices are lifted by the weakened pound. \"Meanwhile, a likely softening labour market and reduced consumer confidence will dilute workers' ability and willingness to push for higher pay awards.\" And even if inflation looks set to rise above the government's target of 2%, he believes the Bank of England is still likely to lower interest rates further to stimulate growth. Mr Archer said he expected the Bank to take interest rates down to 0.10% in November from it current level of 0.25% and said: \"It is notable that the MPC considered taking interest rates down to just above zero at their August meeting and that a majority of members thought there was a case to do so.\"", "question": "Rising @placeholder prices helped to push the UK 's inflation rate higher last month , according to official figures .", "option_0": "data", "option_1": "food", "option_2": "fuel", "option_3": "gold", "option_4": "activity", "label": 2}
{"article": "A Kurdish defence official told Reuters news agency that the drone exploded when the Peshmerga tried to pick it up after it had crashed to the ground. The incident happened on 2 October, north of the IS-held city of Mosul. IS militants are said to have tried to use drones to launch attacks at least two other times in the past month. In response, US-led coalition and Iraqi pro-government forces have been warned to treat any type of small flying aircraft as a potential bomb, according to the New York Times. But few units have been provided with devices that US troops have to disarm them. The French newspaper Le Monde reported on Tuesday that the drone involved in the attack 10 days ago had been intercepted in flight and had exploded near the Peshmerga and French soldiers when it crashed to the ground. A US official told the New York Times the Peshmerga had been examining the drone when a small explosive device disguised as a battery blew up. It was not clear whether the bomb was detonated remotely or contained a timer. On Wednesday, the secretary general of the Kurdistan Region's defence ministry, Jabbar al-Yawar, confirmed the death toll and said the French soldiers had been training the Peshmerga at the time of the attack. The wounded French troops were immediately evacuated to France for medical treatment, Le Monde said, adding that one was \"between life and death\". The French government initially declined to comment on the incident, but a spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that French special forces had been injured. France has sent about 500 troops to Iraq as part of the coalition against IS.

The first performances will be staged by around 40 members of Youth Music Theatre (YMT) in Brighton this weekend. Bourne, who recently reformed the band, said: \"Our aim is to try and create a show that can last forever.\" The musical will feature songs like Air Hostess, Crashed the Wedding and Year 3000, which were among the eight singles Busted released between 2002-04, all reaching the top three in the UK. Bourne has written the show with collaborator Elliot Davis. The pair's first musical was Loserville, which was staged by YMT in 2009 before going on to the West End and being nominated for an Olivier Award. The story of What I Go To School For is \"very truthful\" at heart, according to Bourne. \"The show quite accurately tells story of the band from 2001 to 2005, though some characters are real and some characters are made-up versions of real people. \"Eventually it would be nice to open in the West End after we've had more time to develop.\" As well as working on the musical, Bourne has been back in the recording studio with the band after a break of 10 years. A new Busted album is due for release later this year. \"Matt and Charlie have been asking me lots about the show and they are very interested in what's going on,\" the guitarist and songwriter said. Bourne himself will be played by 15-year-old Joe Riley from Walsall - who was not born when Busted formed. \"During the auditions, period he spent a lot of time with the people that were auditioning for James and correcting anything that was wrong,\" Riley said. \"That's been really good for me because speaking to James about how he was when he was younger has given me a better understanding of him. He's been a massive inspiration of mine for years and years. \"Busted and McFly were the sorts of bands who inspired me to perform, because I always liked their music and I found it really cool to listen to.

{"article": "Anna Kendrick is exhausted. The star of Pitch Perfect 2 is on the promotional trail for the third time this year, making a flying visit to London before going back to work on one of the seven films she has lined up for the next 18 months. \"I can't tell if I'm really jetlagged,\" she laughs, \"but I woke up at three in the morning and, just five minutes ago, I told someone 'goodnight' instead of 'goodbye', so we'll see how this goes.\" Despite this, she's as irreverent and zesty in person as she is on Twitter - devilishly suggesting we use our interview slot to catch some shut eye. \"Five minutes of us sleeping would make compelling TV,\" she argues. Her disregard for the conventions of press junkets is part of the 29-year-old's appeal. She brings a down-to-earth, acerbic edge to all of her films and public appearances, while managing to be warm and likeable. To adapt a well-worn cliche, girls want to be her, and guys want to be her, too. She's that cool. Kendrick first came to attention in her Oscar-nominated role as a no-nonsense management consultant in George Clooney's Up In The Air, but it's in musicals that she's made her name. She got her professional start on Broadway, and was nominated for a Tony Award for playing Dinah in High Society when she was just 12. The original Pitch Perfect - a comedy musical about the quirky world of competitive a capella - was her first lead role and a surprise sleeper hit. Produced for a meagre $17 million, it made $113 million at the box office and another $103 million in home video sales.  It even gave Kendrick a top 10 single in the US. The success made a second movie all-but inevitable. But comedy sequels are notoriously difficult. And musical sequels are even worse. \"Wait, have there been many musical sequels?\" asks Kendrick, astonished. \"I never even thought of this!\" A quick brainstorm brings up Love Never Dies, the ill-fated follow-up to Phantom of the Opera, as well as film flops Blues Brothers 2000 and Grease 2. \"But Grease 2 is kind of fabulous in its own way,\" Kendrick argues, breaking into Michelle Pfeiffer's Cool Rider... A song which brings to mind the full horror of the film. \"No, it's a terrible movie,\" she corrects herself. \"I agree with that.\" Historically speaking, then, the prospects for Pitch Perfect 2 were suitably dim. \"People keep saying that,\" laughs director Elizabeth Banks. \"It's almost as if they're rooting for us to fail.\" Kendrick is more sanguine. \"To me, it felt like the pressure was off because I knew people wanted to see Pitch Perfect 2,\" she says. \"When you do almost every other film, you have no idea if anybody's going to be interested in sitting down and watching your stupid movie.\" Pitch Perfect was based on the true story of an all-female a capella troupe who fought their way to the national finals of a college singing competition. It was adapted from a non-fiction book by Mickey Rapkin, but it was the catty, shrewdly-observed characters - invented by 30 Rock writer Kay Cannon - that gave the movie its real heart. Kendrick played Beca, a spunky freshman dragged reluctantly into the Barden Bellas; but the stand-out was Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy (self-professed so \"twig bitches like you don't do it behind my back\"), who shamelessly stole scenes from the rest of the cast. \"I've got a trophy cabinet now, thanks to Pitch Perfect!\" says the Australian actress. \"The MTV Movie Awards are pretty cool, 'cause they look like popcorn. And sometimes in the middle of the night, you're like 'that's not real popcorn, that's gold!'\" The sequel broadens the scope - as the Barden Bellas square off against German aca-champions Das Sound Machine (an arrogant bunch of \"Deutschbags\") in an international singing contest. But not before Fat Amy destroys the girls' reputation with a mid-air wardrobe malfunction. \"Yeah - there's a 'muffgate', when I expose myself to the President of America,\" Wilson deadpans. \"I did have to train very hard to do that 40-second stunt,\" she says of her acrobatic exposure. \"I only did three takes of the actual routine at 27 feet because it's very dangerous to hang upside down for a long period of time. \"But luckily I smashed it and got to go home early. And then we did a couple of cut-away takes of me hanging upside down by the butt.\" The sequence, filmed at the Lincoln Center, is indicative of the increased ambition (and budget) of the sequel, all of which presented a challenge for first-time director Elizabeth Banks - who also plays commentator Gail Abernathy-McKadden. \"I think I was very naive,\" she laughs. \"I was very confident going in. But it is, of course, a challenge, to give people more of what they loved about the first film but also expand the world. \"What helped is that we had a sweet, small, university-set story the first time around and we had a great opportunity to blow it up this time. \"The musical numbers were all bigger and crazier and more comedic. We just leaned into what people already liked.\" Despite the pressure, Banks, an accomplished comedic actress, allowed her cast to improvise extensively on set. The jokes occasionally got out of hand (expect an 18-rated gag reel), but the best lines undoubtedly go to John Michael Higgins, who plays a staggeringly sexist commentator, calling the Bellas \"an inspiration to girls all over the country who are too ugly to be cheerleaders\". \"He's one of the great improv artists of all time, and he's not afraid of anything,\" says Banks. \"I think comedy has to be very fearless or it just gets bland.\" Kendrick adds: \"There'd be times when we would be doing improv and I'd think 'this is never going in the movie,' but it is! \"I think we definitely pushed it a little further in this one, and somehow managed to sneak it in.\" And if the film matches the success of the first one, is a three-quel on the cards? Banks, who spent so much time editing Pitch Perfect 2 that \"all I see now are the mistakes\", says she won't make a decision in haste. \"If people embrace it in the way we hope that they do, we will absolutely talk seriously about what the next part of this journey could be,\" she says. But she has reservations about where the story of the Bellas could go. \"I think we have to do a big right turn and do something completely different, otherwise we'll be facing off against aliens,\" she laughs. \"We'll be the Avengers of a capella.\" Pitch Perfect 2 reaches cinemas on 15 May, 2015.", "question": "Pitch Perfect 2 is the follow - up to a surprise hit about a university a capella @placeholder - but can it live up to the beloved original ?", "option_0": "musical", "option_1": "group", "option_2": "laboratory", "option_3": "heart", "option_4": "mass", "label": 1}

{"article": "As adept at crafting concert films and documentaries as he was with thrillers, comedies and emotional family dramas, his list of credits shows him to be versatile as well as prolific. Everyone will have their favourites. Personally I have a soft spot for Something Wild, a darkly comic romance from 1986 in which Jeff Daniels realises a date with Melanie Griffith comes with a psychotic ex attached. But if you had to choose the five films that best illustrate his formidable range, you could do a lot worse than picking the following: A footnote in the life of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes formed the basis for this early success. It riffs on the much-disputed relationship between Hughes and Melvin Dummar, a service station owner from Utah who claimed to be one of Hughes's beneficiaries after his 1976 death. It's a quirky story that enabled Demme to muse on the pitfalls of instant celebrity and the way a sudden windfall makes everyone your friend. Mary Steenburgen won an Oscar for playing Melvin's first wife, while Bo Goldman was also rewarded by the Academy for his screenplay. Few directors have captured the electricity and excitement of live performance better than Jonathan Demme. For proof, one need look no further than this film of Talking Heads in concert, shot over three nights in 1983. Featuring such hits as Psycho Killer, Burning Down the House and Once in a Lifetime, it's a perfect marriage of music, cinema and humour. The latter is provided by David Byrne's suit, which gets progressively larger, and absurder, as the film goes on. Another live performance we can enjoy again and again thanks to Demme comes in this vivid record of one of Spalding Gray's acclaimed stage monologues. Focusing on the sometime actor's involvement in 1984 film The Killing Fields, it's a piece that addresses, both comically and poetically, America's own involvement in south-east Asian affairs. Laurie Anderson's score combines with Gray's hypnotising skills as a storyteller to make a riveting hybrid. Demme wasn't the first film-maker to bring Hannibal Lecter to the screen. That honour belonged to Michael Mann and his 1986 thriller Manhunter. Lambs, though, was the one the Academy recognised, awarding it all of the \"big five\" Oscars - best picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay. The film - and Sir Anthony Hopkins' Lecter - still have the power to chill the blood with its grisly autopsy scenes and Grand Guignol atmosphere. What lingers most, though, is the psychological richness and complexity of a film that, uncommonly at the time, put a female heroine - Jodie Foster's dogged Clarice Starling - at the forefront of the action. Two years on from Lambs' Oscar sweep, Tom Hanks won the first of his two back-to-back Oscars for his role as a lawyer with HIV fighting workplace discrimination. The film did much to remove the stigma associated with Aids at the time, not least by earning more than $200m (Â£156m) at the worldwide box office. \"We wanted to reach people who don't know people with Aids, who look down on people with Aids,\" Demme told Rolling Stone in 1994. \"We were calculated about it.

{"article": "However, it emerged earlier that all is not entirely oojah-cum-spiff in the First Ministerial domestic household on the topic of Festive forestry. Ms Sturgeon disclosed that she and her estimable husband, Peter Murrell, always fall out while decorating the tree - but get there in the end. Mr Murrell, it should be said, is customarily one of the calmest individuals in existence. Forgive this havering on the subject of trees. It was prompted by a question from the Conservative backbencher Edward Mountain. The word from the Mountain, once translated, was that forestry was for life, not just for Christmas. He pleaded with the FM to back Caledonian topiary - before resuming his seat, gesturing magnanimously with his sizeable hand to signal that it was Ms Sturgeon's shottie. The Presiding Officer who, unaccountably, reckoned it was up to him to call upon speakers nevertheless acquiesced and matched the Mountainous command. The First Minister was called. And did she wish Yuletide greetings upon one and all, with a beneficent grin? Friends, she did not. Rather, she noted that - when it came to land use - the Tories tended to favour the few, rather than the many. The Mountain looked notably gloomy, as if surrounded by cloud. Mind you, Ms Sturgeon was only giving as good as she got on the Festive front. Opposition leaders each opened with a brief, cheery Festive benison. But they swiftly turned to the Yuletide game of the day: giving the Scottish Government a prolonged kicking. Ruth Davidson got there first for the Conservatives. (Not hard in that she is called first.) Ms Davidson raised the subject of the Auditor General's report anent police funding. The AG, as you will read elsewhere on this site, was less than complimentary. In essence, her complaint is that the books of the Scottish Police Authority are not in a good way - and that longer-term funding for the police may fall short of proclaimed requirements. Ms Davidson addressed the topic like a station sergeant taking a statement from a miscreant in that she appeared notably disinclined to give Ms Sturgeon the benefit of any doubt. We learned one more thing about Nicola Sturgeon this week. She has a phobia towards dogs. She quails at the prospect of a canine encounter. Mind you, she managed to overcome this sufficiently to cuddle a puppy for the cameras, lightly and very briefly. It would seem however that her fear does not extend to her political opponents. Certainly, she opted to attack over the police books - arguing that reforms were in place and that the bobbies' budget would be somewhat better if the UK government would relent and stop charging the Scottish force VAT. Sgt Davidson was undeterred. Her retort, subbed down, was: \"Heard it!\" She was last seen leaving the chamber in search of an Alsatian or poodle, according to availability, with which to confront the FM. Up stepped Labour's Kezia Dugdale. As billed earlier, she tried a quick \"Merry Christmas\" before repeating the police budget charge sheet. Indeed, she accused the FM of trying to sneak it out a few hours before recess. Ms Sturgeon looked and sounded indignant. The timing, she said, had given her opponents an example to question her at length on the topic. She did not say - but probably thought - that, if she had wanted to escape questions, she would have published it tomorrow. Willie Rennie pursued a topic which he has made his own: that of provision for mental health. On this occasion, the Liberal Democrat leader questioned the FM over such care in prison. Ms Sturgeon was notably emollient. One, this is a deeply sensitive topic. Two, she openly conceded that mental health care has been neglected \"for generations\". Three, she might need the Lib Dems to back the SG budget - and mental health provision could be a key issue. Any more? Yes, we had John Mason, the SNP backbencher, challenging the UK government over plans to make holders of public office swear an oath to uphold British values. Mr Mason said he, for one, did not feel particularly British. Ms Sturgeon too seemed unimpressed. She felt such a move was a premature response to the wider Casey report into social cohesion. She doubted whether enforced oaths would assist the integration of diverse communities. Have an utterly splendid Yule.

Blood poisoning or sepsis is a potentially life threatening condition that can be easily treated with antibiotics quickly but is often missed. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish said that while the cause of death was natural, Mrs Cope was not given the \"best chance\" of survival. She added it was \"not possible to say whether Mrs Cope would have survived if treated promptly\". The inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court heard the hospital was overcrowded that day. It had space for 280 patients, but there were 320 patients in the hospital at the time. Mrs Cope, an interior designer, was seen by a nurse who tried to carry out observation tests but could not complete them because of a malfunctioning blood pressure monitor. She took Mrs Cope to the urgent care centre where she asked a colleague to repeat the tests but this took longer than she had hoped because staff there also struggled to get a blood pressure reading. The hospital admitted Mrs Cope should have been treated earlier than she was.

It is not the first time Swift has spoken out against streaming music - she pulled her entire catalogue from Spotify last November and had refused to offer 1989 on streaming services, saying the business had \"shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically\". 1989 went on to become one of the biggest-selling albums of 2014 and has sold more than 4.9 million copies in the US alone.

The panel was told Mr Surgay had been in a \"volatile\" on-off relationship with Deborah Bell since 2009. The hearing was adjourned until 10 August. The pair's relationship had been kept secret as Mr Surgay's wife also served with Nottinghamshire Police, the misconduct panel heard. Ms Bell went on to act as a solicitor for Stephen Shreeves - one of three accused of the murder of Mr Collinge. Shreeves is currently serving a life sentence after being found guilty of murder. Widow Charlotte Collinge was acquitted following a retrial. Mr Surgay, 42, who has served with the force for nearly 19 years, is accused of failing to report the nature of the relationship which, it has been argued, could have potentially compromised a major investigation. Mr Surgay said the relationship was largely platonic, save for a \"drunken fumble\" early on. Force solicitor David Ring said this was inconsistent with the account of Ms Bell, who said the pair were intimate over a period spanning years. Mr Ring said Mr Surgay made no mention of trips he took with Ms Bell to California, Dublin and Germany when questioned by the force's professional standards department. He said: \"You deliberately downplay the nature of your relationship in interview.\" Mr Surgay replied: \"I dispute that.\" Mr Surgay added: \"It was not something I wanted to shout from the rooftops. There's enough rumour and rapture in the police force as it is.\" The officer added he was not aware his relationship with Ms Bell should have been brought to the attention of senior officers and the couple only spoke of the Collinge case in the \"broadest of terms\". Mr Ring said the officer would have been removed from his role in the case had the nature of the relationship come to light, adding it was \"common sense\" he should have disclosed it. Mr Surgay is also facing a further allegation of misusing police systems over \"an extended period of time\" in searching for crimes in and around his home area of Kimberley. The incidents included one where a car registered in his name was reported for making off from a petrol station without paying - knowing as \"bilking\". The officer said the searches were made for policing purposes and that he was \"aghast\" when he saw the alleged bilking incident.

Perched on a craggy outcrop above Towan Beach in Newquay, this property was sold by Lord and Lady Long for £1m in 2012. The island, which is known as both Towan Island and Jago Island, is reached by a private suspension footbridge. The titled couple, in their 80s, said they sold up because they wanted somewhere with a more accessible front door. According to Visit Newquay, the house's occupants have included a reclusive Irish-Canadian eccentric who played the organ at night, and Alexander Lodge, who invented sparkplugs. The current owners of the house, who do not want to be identified, lease the property out for holiday rentals - it costs £4,500 for a week in the summer. With imposing views and an equally imposing address, No 1, The Thames sold last year for a mere £500,000 - which may seem like a bargain for a seven-bedroom mansion within commuting distance of central London. Situated a kilometre (0.6 miles) off the Isle of Grain, roughly where the rivers Thames and Medway meet, Grain Tower Battery is a bomb-proof fort built in about 1855. The drawback? The 160 year-old estuary gun emplacement can only be reached by boat or when the tide is out. The Lime Works in Faversham, Kent, is currently on the market for £1.5m, a mere snip compared to its original sale price of £3.75m. Described by estate agents Savills as an \"impressive and highly individual conversion of two water towers into a spacious and contemporary home\", the 1930s building was a functioning water-softening plant until 1942. The new owner will be able to enjoy a heated rooftop swimming pool, cinema, motion sensor lighting and \"hand-crafted concrete beds and baths\". Work on the house is only 90% finished, \"which will allow the buyer to design and specify the final 10%\". Maybe some taps for the concrete bath would be on the list. This house, named Tracks End, started life as a third-class Midland Railway carriage. Decommissioned from the Tewkesbury Line in 1926, it was transported to Castlemorton, Worcestershire and turned into a two-bedroom house which went on the market in 2014 for £290,000. A bungalow in Helston, Cornwall, was actually built around a railway carriage. Outwardly an ordinary home, Waverley's bathroom and two bedrooms are within the car, while the kitchen, hall and living room are in the surrounding structure. Martello towers are small defensive forts - usually coastal - built during the 19th Century. They played a key role in defending the UK against the threat of Napoleonic invasion Tower number 55, in Norman's Bay near Pevensey in East Sussex, sold for £285,000 in 2004. Planning permission was granted by the local council for the tower to be converted into a two-bedroom house. The water tower in Burton Green near Kenilworth, Warwickshire, is a German-designed Art Deco building with protruding buttresses. The Corporation of Coventry owned the tower before Severn Trent became responsible for water supply in the region. It sold for £250,000 in 2013, with planning permission to convert it into a four-bedroom home. This cricket pavilion in Thurston, Bury St Edmunds, sold for £215,000 in 2012.

A group of unemployed young men are distributing numbers. By midnight they have already given out 200. One called Muchekadzafa confesses they keep some numbers back and sell them to those who don't want to sleep in the queues for $1 each. \"It's an opportunity to survive, because we don't have jobs,\" he says. Zimbabweans are going to extraordinary lengths to withdraw their savings. Often, it's an agonising wait with no guarantees. Banks are open 08:00-15:00 on weekdays and 08:00-11:30 on Saturdays. The previous day the first 165 people received money at this bank. The others came back the following night and they withdrew $50 (Â£40) each. They are back again. Banks have gradually slashed withdrawal amounts over the past year, from $2,000 a day to $100. But most people are lucky to get anything at all. Seven years ago the southern African country abandoned its local currency, which had been made worthless by inflation rates that reached 231 million per cent, and adopted a basket of currencies, mainly the US dollar. The policy change wiped out the Zimbabwe dollar savings overnight, but helped stabilise the economy. Now industries are failing to produce enough goods, imports are outpacing exports and the country is running out of money, again. The central bank has announced plans to introduce a new surrogate currency within the next month but no date has been announced. \"Maybe bonds will end queues, if it means we can sleep in our beds again, it might be the only solution. It doesn't matter that they don't [have] value outside the country.\" The government says the so-called bond note will be pegged in value to the US dollar. But the reaction has been violent, as many people fear it will suffer the same fate as the Zimbabwe dollar. Opposition supporters and members of public have shut down the city centre and blockaded roads with burnt objects in the most violent demonstrations in recent years. They have called for President Robert Mugabe to step down for failing to stem the economic crisis. The announcement of a new currency has also sparked old fears of hyperinflation and fuelled panic withdrawals, especially among the tens of thousands of traders who need foreign currency to buy goods in South Africa for sale locally. \"There is a lot of uncertainty. We are afraid of bond notes because we don't have confidence in it,\" says Stanley Kufandirove as he waits in the queue. \"If its going to help us it's fine, but the issue is confidence - unless we believe in this bond note, it won't work.\" An elderly woman who works as a cleaner is more hopeful: \"Maybe bonds will end queues, if it means we can sleep in our beds again, it might be the only solution. It doesn't matter that they don't [have] value outside the country.\" Zimbabwe's central bank has produced media jingles and plans to embark on a road show to ally public fears. It denies that the bond notes are a way of reintroducing the Zimbabwe dollar through the back door. Rather they will be paid out as an incentive to mineral and agricultural exporters at a rate of 5% for every dollar earned. The bank's governor John Mangudya says they will not overprint the note, which is backed by a US $200m facility. Mr Mangudya has told the public: \"If you don't want the bond notes, use plastic money.\" But the mistrust continues. An elderly man who didn't want to be identified says he still has trillions of worthless notes stuffed in boxes at home. \"Why should we expect more?

{"article": "The two-year long study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) included nearly 500 overweight volunteers who were asked to diet and take more exercise. Half were given a fitness tracker to help them keep tabs. This group had lost less weight than the other one by the end of the trial. The study authors say this does not mean people should ditch the technology altogether, but neither should they put too much faith in them, at least as a slimming aid. Manufacturers say that the  technology has moved on since the study, and that their own research suggests activity trackers can help with weight loss alongside diet and exercise regimes. Despite the popularity of activity trackers, there have been very few studies to see what actual impact they have on weight and fitness levels. The University of Pittsburgh research is one of the first randomised trials to gather such evidence. The investigators found that over the course of the study, the volunteers who wore the fitness trackers had lost, on average, about 8lb (3.6kg). In comparison, the control group that were not given these devices lost about 13lb (5.9kg). The study authors say there are many possible explanations for this surprising finding but, as yet, no proof. Lead researcher Dr John Jakicic said: \"People have a tendency to use gadgets like these for a while and then lose interest with time as the novelty wears off. \"And we did see a drop off in the usage data as the study went on.\" Perhaps people who use fitness trackers became fixated on exercise goals and forgot to follow the diet advice, Dr Jakicic suggested. \"You might think to yourself, 'I'm being so active I can eat a cupcake now,'\" he said. Dr Jakicic said he would like to explore if certain people were more likely than others to benefit from using the technology. For example, a person who was very goal-driven might find tracking their exercise regime very motivating. - but others might just find it depressing. \"It might be very discouraging if you can see that you are not hitting your target all the time,\" he said. He acknowledged that technology had moved on since the study began, but he did not think that would alter the findings. \"What these devices tell us and how we use the information has not changed,\" he said. According to research company CCS Insight, UK sales of wearable devices - activity trackers and smart watches - are expected to reach five million, with 10 million devices expected to be in use before the end of 2016. Dr David Ellis, a psychologist at Lancaster University, who has been researching the rise of consumer health wearables said the JAMA study was helpful because it focused on people who might not normally go out and buy an activity tracker. \"Fitness trackers are more likely to be bought by people who already lead a healthy lifestyle and want to monitor their progress. So it's hard to say if they are useful for everybody,\" he said. \"In real life, obviously, most people won't get the level of support to lose weight that the people in this study did. \"They would have to do it on their own, so wearing a device might be better than nothing.

But after she paid him 200,000 Nigerian naira ($645; £490), she was loaded onto a truck for a harrowing journey to Tripoli. \"A lot of people die in the desert.

Even when we lay down in the desert, we did not know we were sleeping on top of a dead body.  It was when we removed our blankets that we saw - ah this is a skeleton. \" On arrival in Libya, there was \"another pain entirely\", Betty said. She was delivered to a gang which tried to force her into prostitution. She had to buy her freedom by borrowing more money. Now she has paid another trafficker 1,200 Libyan dinars ($860;£655) to take her to Europe. She says she has no choice. \"I need to go because I am a single mother of two boys. I need to go to Germany,\" Betty told the BBC. \"Things are not easy there too I know, but it's much better than Nigeria. My children need to go to school. They need to have a better life.\" Mohammed Garbaj of the Tripoli Coastguard has come across many like Betty, dead and alive. The wiry and weather-beaten skipper has rescued countless numbers, but is haunted by those he could not save. \"One time we went to rescue a boat but unfortunately we found only one person alive,\" he said. \"All the others had drowned - there were 120 of them. The people who send them on these boats are not good Muslims. They are heartless, sending people to die in the sea.\" We joined Mr Garbaj on a search for smugglers and migrants in distress, leaving port in a 12-metre inflatable.  It is the only seaworthy vessel the Tripoli coastguard has - they cannot afford to repair the other three. In pitch darkness Mr Garbaj and his crew switched off their engine and listened out for migrants' vessels. There was little else they could do. They did not have night-vision goggles, and their radar did not detect small boats. They admitted it was the traffickers who ruled the waves. \"The smugglers have more boats and more weapons,\" said Mohammed Boushagour, a young crewmate. \"They have long-range guns. They can escort the migrants to European waters and we can't do anything to stop them. The state doesn't support us. We haven't been paid since March,\" he added. Coastguard officials say there is another problem - Operation Sophia. The European Union mission, which operates just beyond Libya's territorial waters, was supposed to disrupt smuggling. Instead, it is providing \"a taxi service for migrants\", Colonel Ashraf Al Badri, head of the Tripoli Anti-Smuggling Unit, told the BBC. \"From my point of view, it's indirectly encouraging the migrants to go to Europe. Now, they have to travel just 12 miles. Then Operation Sophia rescues them. They are given food and taken to Europe,\" he said. \"Of course, this information spreads. The migrants all know that instead of a dangerous journey lasting more than a day, they will get picked up in four or five hours.\" That view was echoed by a smuggler, now in detention in Tripoli, who the authorities described as a big fish. \"The operation saves life,\" he told the BBC, \"and encourages people to travel more.\" But the IOM argues that with or without Operation Sophia, migrants and refugees will try to reach Europe. \"I can understand what the Libyans are saying about a pull factor, but people will always find ways,\" said its spokesman Itayi Viriri. \"We shudder to imagine what the situation would be like without a concerned rescue effort. The issue of saving lives is paramount.\" Those saved by the Libyan coastguard wind up in detention centres like Abu Salim, on the outskirts of Tripoli. Hundreds are trapped here in what amounts to an airless mini-prison, women and children among them. The youngest detainee we saw was a 21-day-old baby called Mahmud. Many of those we met there were economic migrants, like a 14-year old from The Gambia, in a red and white striped hat. He said he had travelled to Libya alone in the hope of crossing to Europe and finding a job. \"I come from a poor family. I wanted to get to Italy, so I can feed my family. They have not heard from me for two months. They will think I am dead,\" he added. His countryman Abdul Jayie, who is 18, told us the detainees were kept inside for a month at a time. \"Sometimes there are 200-300 people.  We all share two toilets. I feel shame at being a prisoner. I want to go home.\" The authorities say they are doing their best, with scarce resources, at a time when Libya is barely afloat. \"The [food] supplier to our camp gets his money from the state, and he hasn't been paid for a year,\" said Ramadan Rais, the head of Abu Salim. Many of the detainees are visibly desperate to be released. That only happens if they agree to be deported, like the 160 Gambian men who left the centre recently. \"Going back home will be like going to paradise,\" one man said as he queued for a bus. \"I want to see my mother.\" Back on the seashore, Betty is barefoot, with the waves lapping at her feet. \"I am not afraid,\" she said. \"My mind is strong because I believe in God. Every time I look at the sea I say to the water: 'You are not my limit. Nothing will happen to me'.\"", "question": "Only the leg was visible on the beach , protruding from the Libyan shoreline , as though in silent rebuke .

It has been brought forward ahead of the other proposals so it can be implemented in time for next year's Holyrood election. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael told the Commons the move towards extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK was \"irresistible\". Mr Carmichael said it was \"unthinkable\" that 16 and 17-year-olds would not be able to vote in the 2020 general election. Shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran warned against the emergence of a \"two-tier voting\" system, as opposition parties pressed for 16 and 17-year-olds to be given the vote in UK general elections. The SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson also said it was \"shameful\" that the vote was not being extended to the age group for UK Parliament elections. He said it was evidence of Conservatives in England ignoring the democratic will of the Scottish people, as 58 out of 59 Scottish MPs belong to parties who favour lowering the voting age. Concluding the debate on the new regulations, Mr Carmichael said it was clear \"all sorts of practical reasons\" would stop 16 and 17-year-olds voting in May's general election. Mr Carmichael, who told MPs he was speaking personally, added: \"I think it is unthinkable that by the time we come to an election in 2020 that we will not see that election on a franchise that includes 16 and 17-year-olds. \"I think the move in that direction is now irresistible but, of course, that will be for the House to decide on another day.\" Speaking earlier as he introduced the secondary legislation, Mr Carmichael commended the involvement of young people in last year's Scottish independence referendum, which he said was \"truly historic and inspirational to witness.\" For Labour, Ms Curran said: \"If our young people in Scotland have what it takes to decide the future of their country in a referendum and soon the shape of the Scottish government, they have what it takes too to decide the shape of the UK government.\" \"That is why Labour would extend the franchise in all UK elections so that 16 and 17-year-olds can vote too in UK general elections.\" Mr Robertson said: \"I think all of us having gone through the independence referendum experience would want to make sure that that is not a one-off. \"And the fact that we can do it for Scottish Parliament elections is great, the fact that it will happen for local government elections is fantastic. \"The fact that it won't happen for Westminster elections is frankly shameful.\" The transfer of powers to lower the voting age is being carried out through what is known as a section 30 order.

{"article": "One manufacturer is even offering a smart water bottle. Lifefuels won an award at the tech show for the bottle with \"five interchangeable \"fuelpods\" filled with vitamins, nutritional products and flavours, allowing users to tailor their water to suit their specific lifestyles\". Why anyone would need such a product is open to debate but it does raise the question about what \"smart\" really means. For many firms, a so-called smart device is just something connected to the internet but Adam Simon, an analyst with research firm Context, thinks it should be about more. \"The real question is  - what can you do with it? What is it actually doing to help you in your life?\" A Context study found most European home-owners are still reluctant to invest in smart tech - 19% of Britons said that they would buy one smart gadget in the next year and, even then, it would have to cost no more than Â£150. The BBC has been looking at some of the smart tech on offer for the family home at CES. This may just be the craziest thing to come out of CES but it was taken seriously enough by a panel of expert judges to win the CES Launchit ShowStoppers award. Described by founder Leo Trottier as a games console for dogs, the Cleverpet gadget consists of three flashing lights and a treat dispenser. The dog has to press the lights in the right combination in order to win the treat. It also has a microphone and speaker so that pet owners can task their dogs with more complex games - such as touching a particular colour or combination of lights. \"A dog with a job is a happy dog,\" said Mr Trottier as part of his pitch to the judges. \"And my user-base quite literally has nothing else to do.\" He knows a thing or two about training animals - he told the BBC that he taught his cat to use the toilet. More seriously, there are hundreds of pets left home alone each day and Mr Trottier is keen to find a solution to the suggestion that many of these animals are bored. He believes that some dogs will learn to advance to complex levels. There is some serious science behind the design - one member of the team is a neuroscientist who has spent years teaching grammar to birds - and Mr Trottier himself is a cognitive scientist. A little black and white dog named Fiona demoed the system for me, but she could only handle the one button level as she has only been training for a week. Ok, this falls very much into the same category as the smart water bottle as something that is only tenuously smart, and it costs more than Â£150 - retailing in the US for $400 - but, come on, it's a cocktail maker for your home. Bartesian looks a lot like a capsule-based coffee maker and it is basically the alcoholic equivalent. There are reservoirs for the spirits - vodka, rum, tequila and gin - and these must be supplied by the owner. The rest - including the liqueurs which are recreated using non-alcoholic flavours - comes in a capsule. There are six on offer - including margarita, cosmopolitan and zest martini - and each comes with a barcode that is read by the machine making it. The smart home survey from Context revealed that people regard their kitchen as the smartest room in the house, which is a strange choice given that most living rooms now boast a smart TV - but there are plenty of gadgets on show that aim to add to its smartness. Whirlpool has a dishwasher that can be linked to a Nest thermostat, meaning it will run when energy costs are lowest. And there has been quite a lot of buzz around an internet-connected washing machine which is also packed with sensors, designed by a firm called Marathon Laundry. British firm Smarter, makers of the iKettle, has a range of products on show at CES that are considerably cheaper - all under Â£100. They include a smart camera for the fridge which takes real-time photos of your food, and a smart mat for cupboards that reveals what ingredients are in there via an app on a smartphone. We all probably use more water than we need so the idea of a shower that will flash when you have used too much is rather compelling. French firm Start & Blue has developed Hydrao, a system that can be fitted to any shower and which flashes red once a 50 litre limit has passed. The company has already sold around 1,000 units and claims that water use was reduced by an average of 25% when it was used. This one's for the kids and could help parents with that perennial problem of getting them away from their screens. Gemio, a venture-funded, Seattle-based firm, has set out to create a wearable for teenagers that it hopes will appeal to both their desire to express themselves and be sociable. \"The challenge with wearables is getting people to wear it beyond a few months,\" Gemio founder Michael Bettua told the BBC. To counter that, the smart bracelets comes with 35 different designs which clip on and off. Wearers can also design their own. They are also fitted with 22 LED lights which can be used to engage with friends who also own bracelets. The bracelet can flash up different light combinations that correlate to customised messages. \"It is a new form of social networking - kids can send secret messages to each other,\" said Mr Bettua. The bracelet goes on sale in June at a price of $85.

{"article": "A total of 5,746 new cases were reported between September and March, roughly double the 2,833 cases reported in the same period last season. PHE said it was the second period in a row \"with exceptionally high numbers\". Scarlet fever commonly affects young children. Parents should look out for signs of a sore throat, headache, fever and pinkish rash on the chest. The rash, which appears within a day or two, can spread to other parts of the body. Although scarlet fever is now a much less serious infection than it used to be, complications can still arise, particularly in those who are not treated promptly. At present, there is no vaccine for scarlet fever. Public Health England said this is the time of year when the highest number of scarlet fever cases are normally seen and they are likely to tail off after a few weeks. But it said it was unclear why substantial increases in cases had occurred in the past two years. Dr Theresa Lamagni, head of streptococcal infection surveillance at Public Health England, said parents should keep an eye out for signs of scarlet fever. \"Individuals who think they or their child may have scarlet fever should see their GP without delay as antibiotic treatment is needed. \"Symptoms usually clear up after a week and in the majority of cases remain reasonably mild providing a course of antibiotics is completed to reduce the risk of complications. \"As scarlet fever is highly contagious, children or adults diagnosed with scarlet fever are advised to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to avoid passing on the infection.\" GPs, schools and nurseries are being urged to inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases.

{"article": "Dan Coats also told a Senate panel he did not think it was \"appropriate\" to discuss his conversations with the president at a public hearing. His comments follow a report that President Donald Trump asked him to derail the Russia investigation. The National Security Agency chief also declined to comment on the matter. Admiral Mike Rogers told a Senate intelligence committee on Wednesday he has never \"been directed to do anything illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate\" as NSA director. Mr Coats echoed Mr Rogers' statements as senators pressed the pair on their interactions with the president. \"I'm willing to come before the committee and tell you what I know and don't know,\" he said. \"What I'm not willing to do is share information I think ought to be protected in an opening hearing,\" Mr Coats told the panel. He is later appearing in a closed session before the committee on Wednesday afternoon. This Senate testimony by intelligence community heads was billed as the undercard to James Comey's appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but it turned out to be a big letdown. Top intelligence officials in the US government have taken a bunker mentality when it comes to the investigation into Russian meddling in the US election, refusing to share details of presidential conversations in open Senate testimony. Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation, it seems, has the spooks spooked. That may come as a relief to a White House that has been buffeted by a seemingly never-ending stream of controversial revelations, from allegations that the president attempted to influence the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to reports of internal divisions within the administration. The president and his aides shouldn't breath easy, however. Although today's testimony was largely a dud, Mr Comey - no longer a government employee, thanks to Mr Trump - will have more leeway to discuss his interactions with the president if he so chooses. His former colleagues my have seen discretion as the better part of valour, but the former director isn't known for backing down from a fight. Mr Coats testimony comes a day after the Washington Post reported that he told associates Mr Trump had tried to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his ties to the Kremlin. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as \"fake news\". The two intelligence chiefs joined acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify before the panel on Wednesday. The lack of answers appeared to frustrate both Democratic and Republican senators, who repeatedly pressed the intelligence officials on the Russia inquiry. Republican Senator Richard Burr, who chairs the committee, ended the hearing by appearing to rebuke the intelligence officials for their testimony. \"At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer,\" he said. The following day will see the much-anticipated testimony of Mr Comey, who was leading one of the Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. He will be quizzed on his interactions with the president before he was sacked. Mr Comey reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president. The conversation occurred the day after the president asked Mr Comey to end the investigation into Mr Flynn during a private dinner, according to the New York Times.

{"article": "VR firms such as Oculus and Samsung have concentrated on developing headsets for use at home. But the Void will open its first entertainment centre in Utah in the autumn. One expert said the idea of a physical VR park seemed \"pretty compelling\". The Void's founder Curtis Hickman wants to open virtual reality parks in \"cities all around the world\". \"The Void is about creating the most immersive technology, so instead of sitting at your desk, you walk around an environment. It is a tangible world that seems like it never ends,\" he told the BBC. \"People like to feel that they are somewhere else, and feel the mist in a cave or the heat from a fire - or believe that they are going up in an elevator.\" That experience is creating using haptic vests and a backpack alongside the more familiar VR headset. The version at TED was a bespoke creation that challenged players to solve puzzles as they walked around an ancient tomb. I have tried a few VR headsets in my time but generally I am very aware that, despite the amazing visions I can see through the goggles, I am basically standing in a room moving my head around in an odd fashion. Entering the Void was a very different experience and felt like I had finally fulfilled my childhood dream of stepping inside the TV. There are walls to touch and a stone throne that you are invited to sit on. It all takes place in a small room but the space feels much larger, with corridors that lead to jungles and pools full of sea monsters. You have to pick up virtual torches and when walls crumble you believe that the bricks are falling on you. Despite believing entirely in the world I entered - and feeling like Indiana Jones - I didn't scream when I met a monster or fall down a pit having failed to solve the problem correctly. This was partly because I experienced the Void with a partner, who I rather feebly suggested went first around every corner.. But it was also because I remained aware at all times that this wasn't \"real\". Had I remained there longer than the 10 minutes it took to complete - and I could happily have stayed inside for hours - I may have started to believe more deeply in my strange new reality. Coming back to a somewhat grey Vancouver was a bit disappointing and made me wonder about how we are going to cope with reality when such exciting worlds are just a headset away. The entertainment centres being planned by the Void will offer a range of content and will be family friendly. Ina Fried, a journalist for technology website Recode, enjoyed her test run. \"It was a little rough around the edges but still fun and very immersive,\" she told the BBC. \"It does allow people to get their first taste of VR without having to plunk down cash to buy new gadgets.\" Chris Savage, chief executive of video hosting platform Wistia said: \"I've not experienced it myself but it sounds like laser tag taken to the millionth degree.\" \"The challenge will be to build different physical spaces to experience it in,\" he added. As virtual reality becomes ubiquitous, he thinks the Void raises questions about how people will react to an alternative reality. \"Is it too real for some people? Do you forget you are a person if your avatar is too real?\" Curtis Hickman joked that, while there was a place for the real world, he preferred the Void. \"I know when I get out I want to go straight back in - it's an adventure that is difficult to have any other way,\" he said. He added, on a more serious note, that he hoped the virtual world \"would translate into the real world and help people to live their lives even better\".

{"article": "A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization said agriculture accounted for about a fifth of emissions, which it said needed to be reduced. The State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report said \"business as usual\" would leave millions at risk from hunger. Last year, nations adopted a UN goal of ending hunger by 2030. \"The climate is changing, so agriculture must change too,\" explained Rob Voss, director of FAO's Agricultural Development Economics division. \"We are saying that because agriculture is already very affected by the impacts of climate change, particularly the countries in the tropical zones. \"Also, agriculture is contributing itself to about one fifth of the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,\" Mr Voss, who headed the team that produced the FAO State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report, added. \"If we continue along the present pathways then we will not be able to [deliver] food security around the world and we will not be able to stabilise the climate.\" As a result, he told BBC News, there was a need for \"major changes\" to take place in the sector. \"One of the challenges is agriculture itself. As soon as we shovel the ground then we are already releasing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, as it is so dependent on water and quality of land, any impact from the change in climate has a direct impact.\" Therefore, he said, the challenge was bearing these changes in mind and looking at ways to shift to a more sustainable footing. \"A lot of the technologies that are available that allow us to do things differently do face a number of hurdles, especially when it comes to smallholder farmers in developing countries.' These include the cost of changing the way farmers produce their food; knowledge of shifting to the novel ways of farming; urbanisation; access to water. In terms of making the change to deliver a robust global food system, Mr Voss said the report highlighted four steps that could be taken: \"First, put in the steps that would help farmers switch to more sustainable practices, such as more efficient use of fertilizers and using heat tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties.\" He added that management systems, such as agroforestry - which places forestry cultivation around farmlands, would also be beneficial as it helps farmers build in great resilience against the impacts of climate change. \"Secondly, we need to work harder to increase the capacity of soils and forestry to sequestrate carbon. Deforestation and changes to land-use is one of the major sources of emissions from the sector. \"A third area where we can immediately start work on is to reduce food losses and waste. We estimate that about one third of the food we produce gets lost in the post-harvest process or gets wasted at the consumer end. \"The fourth area, which is more challenging, is to try and do something about people's diets. What we have been seeing around the world is a clear shift towards increasing demands for food products that put a lot more pressure on natural resources.\" The report observed: \"Rebalancing diets towards less animal-sourced foods would make an important contribution in this direction, with probable co-benefits for human health.\" FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva said that the coming twelve months should be about \"putting commitments into action\", referring to the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of delivering \"zero hunger\" by 2030. He also observed that agriculture was set to be one of the main topics for discussion at the forthcoming UN climate summit in Morocco in November. \"Climate change threatens all dimensions of food security,\" Mr Graziano da Silva warned. \"It will expose both urban and rural poor to higher and more volatile food prices. It will also affect food availability by reducing the productivity of crops, livestock and fisheries.\" He stated: \"Hunger, poverty and climate change need to be tackled together.\" Follow Mark on Twitter.", "question": "The global farming sector has a big role to play in the effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and @placeholder to future climate change , the UN says .", "option_0": "race", "option_1": "adapting", "option_2": "appears", "option_3": "devoted", "option_4": "lead", "label": 1}

Heather Blake, of Prostate Cancer UK, said that for some people who have prostate cancer cabazitaxel chemotherapy was \"the only remaining treatment choice after other treatments have stopped working\". She added: \"Today's decision robs these men in Scotland of precious extra time with loved ones while men in a similar situation in England and Wales are given access. \"This is grossly unfair and baffling given that the information presented at both appraisals was the same. \"We therefore urge the SMC and the manufacturer to do everything in their power to get this treatment approved.\" Rob Jones, professor of clinical cancer research at the Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, said: \"Despite recent advances in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, clinical trials conducted in Glasgow and elsewhere have demonstrated that cabazitaxel is a life-prolonging treatment for some patients.\" While the SMC rejected cabazitaxel, it approved new treatments for advanced Parkinson's disease, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and severe asthma, among others. Katherine Crawford, of the charity Parkinson's UK, said she was \"delighted\" the SMC had given the go-ahead for co-careldopa - which is also known as Duodopa - to be used by the NHS. She added: \"Parkinson's specialists will now be able to prescribe Duodopa without having to apply to their NHS board each time.

The father-of-two, who managed to hold down his job at a truck rental firm, said his kind of experience shows how homelessness is often misunderstood. He spoke out after the Manchester Evening News revealed a man who died in a van fire was living in the vehicle. Homelessness charity The Wellspring, in Stockport, said the man worked in the building industry and had been in the process of trying to find a home. Mr Brobbey, 50, said: \"I had too much dignity to ask for help. Now I want to help others.\" Originally from Ancoats, Manchester, he said a break-up in 2012 left him with \"no choice\" but to leave his home, and financial problems made matters worse. \"To cut a long story short I just didn't have anywhere to go,\" he said.

{"article": "A team from Cardiff University has spent the last month excavating Caerau hill fort near Ely. It is smaller than its contemporaries at Pentyrch and Pontprennau and had been thought to be inferior in status. But structures and artefacts so far unearthed suggest the fort remained important well into the Roman era. Until now it has been thought that the fort was purely a stronghold of the Silurian tribe who inhabited this part of Wales from around the 5th Century BC, falling into disuse once they were finally defeated by the Romans, circa 75 AD. However the initial dig this summer has uncovered a considerable amount of new information, including three Iron Age roundhouses and a stone-built pathway that runs around the edge of the hill fort, suggesting to the experts a possible domestic and/or political dimension. Also, the mix of Silurian and Roman artefacts may indicate that the fort was occupied much later than had been thought, and that the two groups might have mingled there. Dr Oliver Davis, from the university's School of History, Archaeology and Religion, said: \"People think of these sites as defensive structures, but our attention is turning to whether the people who lived there were actually developing a community or collective identity for themselves. \"Our community excavations show that occupation at the site continued until at least the third century AD, well into the Roman period. \"Domestic life is indicated by the discovery of simple tools and ceramics from all periods. \"A glimpse of the personality of the inhabitants is provided by the discovery of a glass bead of Iron Age date and an enamelled disc brooch of Roman date. \"Both these objects indicate that individuals were concerned with their appearance, and that life in the past was a little more colourful than we sometimes think. \"Over the past month the team has also examined the inner of the three ramparts that surround the hill fort. These ramparts and their associated ditches were unlikely to have been built just for defence.\" But as well as colour from the past, Dave Horton, of the community organisation Action in Caerau and Ely, said the way local residents have had a hand in the discoveries has also lent a little colour to the present. \"The last few weeks have seen a whirlwind of activity in Ely and Caerau focused around our beautiful iron-age hill fort,\" he said. \"Literally hundreds of local people have visited the site and have dug together, learned new skills, shared local knowledge, and have celebrated together with a fantastic Iron Age hog roast.\" \"We have all walked down the hill to our homes with a different perspective.

{"article": "The previously secret justice department memo was published after a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and The New York Times. Anwar al Awlaki was killed by a US drone attack in Yemen in 2011. Critics have said Awlaki was killed without being given his right to legal due process as an American citizen. The memo argues the killing was legal because he was an \"operational leader\" of an \"enemy force\" at war with the US. Analysis - Aleem Maqbool, Washington DC The justification of the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki under the established laws of armed conflict focuses on the view he posed the imminent threat of a violent attack against the US. He had been linked to numerous plots to kill Americans, including the shootings at a military base in Texas in 2009 in which 13 people died. However there are legal experts who dispute the claim that Awlaki was beyond capture, and others who question whether the rules of \"war\" can be applied to the fight against militants around the world, including Yemen. Even for those who accept the rationale for Anwar al-Awlaki's extrajudicial killing in 2011, it is harder to justify the apparently inadvertent deaths of two other American citizens killed in drone attacks around the same time, including Awlaki's 16-year-old son. Jameel Jaffer, an ACLU lawyer who argued the case, said the memo's release \"represents an overdue but nonetheless crucial step towards transparency\". \"There are few questions more important than the question of when the government has the authority to kill its own citizens.\" The document, still partially redacted, also says the killing of Awlaki by US military forces would be legal under an authorisation for the use of US force after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington DC. It is dated July 2010, more than a year before Awlaki was killed. Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American Muslim cleric of Yemeni descent, was linked to a series of attacks and plots across the world - including the 9/11 attacks and the shootings at Fort Hood in November 2009. Awlaki was born in 1971 in the southern US state of New Mexico, where his father, Nasser, a future Yemeni agriculture minister and university president, was studying agricultural economics. He lived in the US until the age of seven, when his family returned to Yemen. He returned again for more than a decade to study and work, but left in 2002. His family mounted a legal challenge after he was put on a US \"kill list\", authorising his death by the CIA, in order to stop the execution of one of its citizens without any judicial process.", "question": "A New York court has released the Obama administration 's legal justification for the killing of a US citizen and @placeholder al - Qaeda leader in Yemen .", "option_0": "suspected", "option_1": "targeted", "option_2": "twisted", "option_3": "buried", "option_4": "wounded", "label": 0}
{"article": "UK scientists say they were \"amazed\" to find an example of such a sophisticated arithmetic calculation in biology. Mathematical models show that the amount of starch consumed overnight is calculated by division in a process involving leaf chemicals, a John Innes Centre team reports in e-Life journal. Birds may use similar methods to preserve fat levels during migration. The scientists studied the plant Arabidopsis, which is regarded as a model plant for experiments. Overnight, when the plant cannot use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into sugars and starch, it must regulate its starch reserves to ensure they last until dawn. Experiments by scientists at the John Innes Centre, Norwich, show that to adjust its starch consumption so precisely, the plant must be performing a mathematical calculation - arithmetic division. \"They're actually doing maths in a simple, chemical way - that's amazing, it astonished us as scientists to see that,\" study leader Prof Alison Smith told BBC News. \"This is pre-GCSE maths they're doing, but they're doing maths.\" The scientists used mathematical modelling to investigate how a division calculation can be carried out inside a plant. During the night, mechanisms inside the leaf measure the size of the starch store. Information about time comes from an internal clock, similar to the human body clock. The researchers proposed that the process is mediated by the concentrations of two kinds of molecules called \"S\" for starch and \"T\" for time. If the S molecules stimulate starch breakdown, while the T molecules prevent this from happening, then the rate of starch consumption is set by the ratio of S molecules to T molecules. In other words, S divided by T. \"This is the first concrete example in biology of such a sophisticated arithmetic calculation,\" said mathematical modeller Prof Martin Howard, of the John Innes Centre. The scientists think similar mechanisms may operate in animals such as birds to control fat reserves during migration over long distances, or when they are deprived of food when incubating eggs. Commenting on the research, Dr Richard Buggs of Queen Mary, University of London, said: \"This is not evidence for plant intelligence. It simply suggests that plants have a mechanism designed to automatically regulate how fast they burn carbohydrates at night.

He said the bill \"protects sincerely held religious beliefs and moral convictions\". Protesters say the bill would allow for lawful discrimination of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. The bill comes at a time when numerous US states are passing or considering similar laws. North Carolina recently passed a bill that revokes protections for LGBT people and requires transgender individuals to use restrooms based on their biological gender identity. Major companies and CEOs signed on to a letter urging North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to repeal the law. Tech company PayPal has withdrawn its plan to open an operations centre, which would have employed 400 people, over the law. The governor of Georgia rejected a similar bill after pressure from major companies that do business in the state. States have been drawing up religious freedom laws, largely under pressure from religious groups, in response to the US Supreme Court ruling last summer legalising gay marriage. The intention of the Mississippi bill, the \"Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act,\" is to protect people who think marriage is between one man and one woman, that sexual relations should only happen in marriages and that gender is not changeable. Mr Bryant, defending himself on Twitter after signing the bill, said the bill does not limit rights of citizens under the US Constitution and was designed to \"prevent government interference in the lives of the people\". Churches, religious charities and private business can use the law to legally not serve people whose lifestyles they disagree with. Governments must still provide services, but individual government employees can use the law to opt out. The bill also ensures that anyone who wishes to establish \"sex-specific standards\" for restrooms and dressing rooms is free to do so. \"This bill flies in the face of the basic American principles of fairness, justice and equality and will not protect anyone's religious liberty,\" the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement following the bill's passage. \"Far from protecting anyone from 'government discrimination' as the bill claims, it is an attack on the citizens of our state, and it will serve as the Magnolia State's badge of shame.\"", "question": "The governor of Mississippi has signed a controversial bill that allows businesses to refuse service to gay @placeholder based on religious beliefs .", "option_0": "couples", "option_1": "close", "option_2": "clients", "option_3": "customers", "option_4": "traffic", "label": 0}

{"article": "John Cridland, director general of the employers' group, says England's exam system is narrow and out of date. He proposes a system in which the most important exams would be A-levels, including both academic and vocational subjects, taken at the age of 18. Ministers are pushing for all pupils to take a core group of academic GCSEs. \"By the end of this parliament, I want to see the date for the last GCSEs circled in the secretary of state's diary,\" said Mr Cridland, who warns of a \"false choice\" between academic and vocational lessons. In a speech at the annual Festival of Education at Wellington College, Mr Cridland will set out an employers' blueprint for improving schools. He says that for too long \"we've just pretended\" to have an exam system that values vocational education, when in practice, exams have operated as stepping stones towards a university degree. Mr Cridland argues that GCSEs have been made an irrelevance when pupils stay in education or training until the age of 18. In having such major exams at the age of 16, he says: \"We have to face the uncomfortable truth that - internationally - we're the oddballs.\" \"GCSEs are past their sell-by date and should be retired.\" He says that the only purpose they serve now is to allow measurement of schools through league tables. The proposal to scrap GCSEs comes as ministers are pushing for an even greater emphasis on academic GCSEs, with plans for all pupils to have to take core academic subjects. This announcement \"misses the point that we need curriculum reform, not just exam reform\", says the CBI chief. \"The government must make a start on a full review of 14-to-18 education by the end of the summer.\" Mr Cridland describes the current vocational education as a \"restricted, unloved range of options\" and \"a social and economic own goal\". \"Non-academic routes should be rigorous and different to academic ones, but not second best.\" The lack of a strong vocational education at the moment means that many pupils are poorly served, he says, as not all children are suited to a narrowly academic approach. For employers, it can mean that they have to carry out \"remedial\" work with young recruits to get them ready for the workplace. From the perspective of employers, he says the school system needs to teach skills beyond academic lessons, such as character and resilience. \"Debates about schools structure and exam reform are sterile if they aren't linked to outcomes for young people. And that is a missing link in our system.\" He also called for an Ofsted system that recognises innovation, rather than an excessive focus on data. \"Rebel head teachers succeed in spite of the system, not because of it,\" he says. Mr Cridland also wants more engagement from business in education. The lack of good quality careers education remains a major problem, he says, and he argues that businesses should play a bigger part in making links between school and employment. \"Schools shouldn't be places where businesspeople drop their kids at the beginning of the day like they drop off their dry-cleaning,\" he says. The Department for Education said: \"A rigorous academic curriculum until age 16 is the best way to ensure that every child succeeds, regardless of their background, and allows us to be ambitious for everyone, to keep options open and horizons broad.\" A department spokeswoman said A-levels had been reformed \"to ensure they are equipping young people with the skills and knowledge for higher education and the world of work\".", "question": "The head of the CBI says a date must be set in the next five years to scrap GCSEs and introduce an exam system with equal @placeholder for vocational subjects .", "option_0": "advice", "option_1": "success", "option_2": "support", "option_3": "status", "option_4": "validity", "label": 3}

{"article": "In the main city of Tambacounda in Senegal's eastern region, the main bus terminal is hardly ever empty. Located 600km (370 miles) east of the capital Dakar, the impoverished region borders Mauritania, Mali, Guinea and The Gambia. Many of the region's residents go abroad to flee poverty. Aissatou Sanogo's husband, Souleymane, was one of them. She is only 25 years old but her features are drawn. She is wearing the white veil of recent widows. \"He left on 6 November,\" she says. \"He went to Bamako in Mali and spent five days there, then he went to Libya. He spent five months there, and on 18 April, he boarded a boat to Europe. The accident happened on 19 April. I heard he was in the hospital or with the Red Cross. But on 11 June, I was told my husband had drowned.\" Mrs Sanogo shows pictures of their wedding and of the baptism of their three children, emphasizing the fact that she had not wanted her husband to leave his job delivering bread. \"I told him that I did not want him to go because I would much rather have my husband close to me,\" she said. \"I told him that even if we did not have a lot, he was earning some money and that I was not asking for much. But he insisted that he wanted to give us a better life, and not depend on anyone, and also provide for his sick father.\" Throughout Tambacounda, scores of people tell a similar story - a husband, father or brother who died trying to reach Europe illegally. Here, many travel agencies offer bus tickets to neighbouring countries. From Tambacounda, most migrants go to Mali, and from there to Burkina Faso and then to Niger's northern town of Agadez, from where they travel across the Sahara desert into Libya. It is the last stop on land before people smugglers put them on boats towards Italy. But many are unprepared for what happens on the way, says Aliou Mbow, 23: \"Travelling conditions are so hard, even to get to Libya. \"You can get hit and sometimes people even get killed. For example, if there is an accident, or you fall from the truck in the desert and break your leg, the driver can pull out a gun and eliminate you, and then we keep on going. Nobody dares to ask for anything.\" Mr Mbow made it to Libya but then there was some trouble on the boat to Italy. His group was lucky enough to be able to sail back to Libya. He decided it was not worth risking his life again so he went back to Senegal. Some local media have reported that in Senegal, the Tambacounda region has had the highest number of deaths since April due to illegal migration. \"Even after what happened in April, there are still people leaving,\" says Harouna Cisse, a teacher who has not had any news from his brother since he went on the perilous journey. \"Each day some young people take the trip, each and every day. This is because of unemployment.  There is nothing here in Tambacounda, no infrastructure, and the government just keeps on making promises.\" Expressing a similar view, Ibrahima Traore, the head of a youth group in Tambacounda, says: \"Even if you graduate from a training programme you find no real economic prospect, no company to offer jobs here.\" \"Illegal migration is not a new phenomenon, but it is on the rise these past few years. And the government is just standing idly by.\" There are still no statistics to evaluate the scale of the problem in a region where the official unemployment rate in 2013 stood at 36.5%, though some analysts say it is likely to be lower because it fails to take into account jobs in the informal sector. Bassirou Fall is a regional official from the ministry of youth. He cannot say how many have left or how many have died. He just knows how many made it back alive - 75 young men have been repatriated since the beginning of the year. He admits the crisis is partly caused by \"numerous failures in employment public policies\". \"The profiles of returnees are young people from rural areas that were unemployed, or poor farmers,\" he says. \"According to their testimonies it is because they could not bear to see their parents struggle to provide for the family that they resorted to illegal migration. So we want to help them return to agriculture. We want to start vast and well-equipped farming structures to allow young people to work in them.\" No-one knows exactly when those new farms will be set up. In the meantime, nothing is done for families who have lost their breadwinners to illegal migration. Each day, the widowed Mrs Sanogo bathes her children in a small bucket in front of her house. She does not expect much from the government. The mother of three relies only on help from her poor family.

{"article": "Forces under his command have seized control of Libya's main oil terminals, handing the key to the country's crucial oil exports to his ally - the elected parliament based in the eastern city of Tobruk. Born in 1943 in the eastern town of Ajadbiya, Haftar was one of the group of officers led by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi which seized power from King Idris in 1969. Gaddafi put Haftar - recently promoted to field marshal - in charge of the Libyan forces involved in the conflict in Chad in the 1980s. This proved to be his downfall, as Libya was defeated by the French-backed Chadian forces, and Haftar and 300 of his men were captured by the Chadians in 1987. Having previously denied the presence of Libyan troops in the country, Gaddafi disowned him. This led Haftar to devote the next two decades towards toppling the Libyan leader. He did this from exile in the US state of Virginia. His proximity to the CIA's headquarters in Langley hinted at a close relationship with US intelligence services, who gave their backing to several attempts to assassinate Gaddafi. After the start of the uprising against Gaddafi in 2011, Haftar returned to Libya where he became a key commander of the makeshift rebel force in the east. With Gaddafi's downfall, Haftar faded into obscurity until February 2014, when he outlined on TV his plan to save the nation and called on Libyans to rise up against the elected parliament, the General National Congress (GNC), whose mandate was still valid at the time. His dramatic announcement was made at a time when Libya's second city, Benghazi, and other towns in the east had in effect been taken over by the local al-Qaeda affiliate, Ansar al-Sharia, and other Islamist groups who mounted a campaign of assassinations and bombings targeting the military, police personnel and other public servants. Although Haftar did not have the wherewithal to put his plan into action, his announcement reflected popular sentiment, especially in Benghazi, which had become disenchanted with the total failure of the GNC and its government to confront the Islamists. Haftar's popularity is not necessarily shared elsewhere in the country where he is remembered more for his past association with Gaddafi and his subsequent US connections. He is also detested by Islamists who resent him for confronting them in Benghazi and elsewhere in the east. In May 2014 Haftar launched Operation Dignity against Islamist militants in Benghazi and the east. In March 2015 Libya's elected parliament, the House of Representatives (HoR) - which had replaced the GNC - appointed him commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA). After a year of little progress, in February 2016 the LNA pushed the Islamist militants out of much of Benghazi. By mid-April this had been followed up by further military action that dislodged the Islamists from their strongholds outside Benghazi and as far as Derna, 250km east of Benghazi. In September 2016, the LNA launched operation \"Swift Thunder\", seizing from the Petroleum Facilities Guard - an armed group aligned with the UN-brokered Government of National Accord (GNA) - the key oil terminals of Zueitina, Brega, Ras Lanuf and Sidrah, in the oil-rich heartland locally known as the Oil Cresent. In recognition of this, the Speaker of the HoR and supreme commander of the armed forces, Agilah Saleh, promoted Haftar from lieutenant-general to field marshal. Haftar is reported to be unhappy with the line-up of the GNA, which has allocated the defence portfolio to another officer, Ibrahim al-Barghathi. And he is suspicious of the GNA's reliance on the mainly Misrata-based militias, which include some Islamist elements. The Skhirat agreement of December 2015, which laid the foundation for the national unity government, stipulated that the HoR meet within one month of the proposed unity government to consider whether to grant it a vote of confidence. However, after several attempts the HoR, has failed to attain the necessary quorum to vote on the proposed cabinet. According to media reports, proponents of the unity government within the HoR blame this on Haftar, who is said to have persuaded his supporters among the deputies to deprive the legislature of the necessary number of attendants. Haftar insists that he will abide by any decision taken by the HoR. While he has been ambiguous about his own political ambition, it is likely that this is confined to a key role for himself in the new army under the national unity government and, more generally, for the LNA in the new armed forces.

{"article": "The two-day extension was granted after the government website for registering voters failed just before Tuesday's original deadline. A prominent Leave campaigner has said he is considering launching a legal challenge to that decision. Leave.EU founder Arron Banks said there were grounds for a judicial review of the \"unconstitutional\" move. The government had pushed through emergency legislation to allow people to register until 23:59 BST on Thursday. The extension to the deadline covered everywhere apart from Northern Ireland, where the online system was not in use. The referendum on whether or not the UK remains in the EU will be held on 23 June. Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin said in the hour leading up to the crash that there had been 214,000 registration applications. Tuesday's rise was \"three times as intense a spike as occurred before the general election\" he said, and it would have taken a spike \"six times as large\" to cause the site to fail again, he told MPs. According to the official government website, there were 242,000 applications to register to vote on Wednesday, the second highest total since mid-May when a registration campaign was launched. Of these, 135,600 were from people aged under 35. There were a further 195,000 applications on Thursday, taking the overall two-day total to 437,000 applications. The proportion of applications coming from younger age groups continued to be very high, as it was in the days before the deadline - 77% of those applying were from the youngest three age groups, meaning they were under 45. Mr Banks, an insurance millionaire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday: \"We've got lawyers that are looking at [the extension] at the moment. \"They are tending to say it's unconstitutional because once you've set the rules you can't really change it halfway through, and Parliament really shouldn't be doing this.\" BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said many Leave campaigners saw the deadline extension as a \"fix\" because they think people who signed up late will be younger and therefore more likely to support the EU. The official leave campaign - Vote Leave, in which Mr Banks plays no part - has said the government was trying to register as many likely Remain voters as possible, but stopped short of suggesting that it would consult lawyers.", "question": "More than 430,000 people applied to register to vote in the EU referendum during the @placeholder deadline period .", "option_0": "voting", "option_1": "planned", "option_2": "extended", "option_3": "race", "option_4": "initial", "label": 2}
{"article": "This guy that they'd known for his fearsome reputation as one of national hunt racing's hardest, and most difficult opponents to beat, was now motionless from the neck down, and struggling at times to breathe let alone speak. But, remarkably, McNamara and his wife Caroline refused to be downcast, preferring to confront their plight head-on, politely asking visitors to take any tears they might care to shed outside the room. It was that attitude of bloody-minded determination not to give in - AP McCoy had a tone of awe in his voice, I thought, when describing his friend on BBC radio as \"very mentally strong\" - that made him such an inspiration to so many. And, my goodness, strength of extraordinary quantities was needed after the winner of Cheltenham Festival trophies and holder of point-to-pointing records was so cruelly propelled from saddle to 24-hour care that March afternoon in 2013. Miraculously, when you consider the gloomy prognosis as the air ambulance took him away from the racecourse, he eventually got home to County Limerick, the area of his birth, to a specially-designed bungalow, and started working with a small number of horses and even making occasional trips to the races. His changing room colleagues have, of course, felt it all most keenly, in the knowledge that this fate could so easily have befallen them; horses fall in jump races every day of every week, and an inch here or an inch there can make all the difference in terms of walking away or not. But in addition, McNamara's story resonated across the racing world and on to the wider public probably to a large extent because of its poignancy. When Galaxy Rock fell, at the first fence, in the Festival's Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Chase, the then 37-year-old was considered to still be very much at the top of his game, and memories of great days and celebrations with Cheltenham winners like the prolific Spotthedifference and Teaforthree were fresh in the memory. Although he'd never turned professional, the principal reason had nothing to do with ability, but, crucially, that amateur status allowed him to remain a big riding fish on Ireland's renowned point-to-pointing circuit, something of a show window for potential buyers. So, he was, as they say, going well, but he'd also spoken to friends about the possibility of retiring in the not too distant future; heartbreakingly, the decision was never his to make. And then last year, in a barely believable twist, his first cousin Robbie McNamara was confined to a wheelchair by a fall, in Ireland, on the eve of the Grand National at Aintree in which he was due to take part. Happily, Robbie has recovered enough to be training and, to considerable all-round pleasure, saddled his first winners in July to create some rays of light in what has otherwise been a desperately sad series of events. The story of JT McNamara will, however, never be forgotten: memories of his rampant success in the saddle won't allow that, nor will his extraordinary courage in the face of adversity.

{"article": "But then the former lead singer and guitarist with the White Stripes is a man who thrives on contradictions, all the more so in his new life as a solo artist. Nowhere is that more obvious than in his pride and joy, the headquarters of Third Man Records. It's a low rise building in a Nashville side street, grittily functional from the outside. Inside, it is a dream sequence from a David Lynch film, minus dwarves. For this interview, we are not allowed to shoot in \"the lounge\", which is a shame as it seems designed as a film set. The ceiling is made of shiny tin, the floor is a bright yellow, and the space in between the two is artfully filled with animal heads and old turn-tables. Peer past the stuffed bongo (a type of antelope, apparently) making its way through fake vegetation and you'll see two huge skulls on a coffee table. They used to belong to a hippo and giraffe. The kitchen area is decked out in bright red and white tiles, like an old-fashioned hospital. The entrance to White's own office is a glass and wood dentist's door, etched with the \"John White the Third\". Controlled kookiness abounds. But Jack White is insistent that nothing he does is some empty pose. \"I don't like image for the sake of image,\" he says. \"There has to be meaning underneath it. There has to be a reason for what colour is where and why it's used.\" \"I hate that, I hate when people think that something just looks cool and they have no thought behind it. It drives me absolutely crazy, it has to come from a place that means something.\" He tells me the stuffed animals are about inspiring a sense of humility and mortality. Zany decor in creative offices is not unknown, but few artistic types put their staff in uniforms. Here it's black ties and white shirts for the boys, something yellow for the girls. I tell him it made me wonder if he was the Willy Wonka of rock-and-roll. He laughs. \"You know when you have a building like this... the first thing that people think of is you're controlling and you're a micro-manager. But it's the bigger picture I care about, not the finest details of it.\" \"I think if you trust other people they'll take care of all the fine details for you. And for themselves.\" So what's the meaning underneath those uniforms? It is all about colour. Before he became a garage rocker, Jack White made furniture. The message, it seems, came before the medium. \"The colours of black, white and yellow go all the way back to my upholstery hand tools. The hand tools were yellow and black. When I got my cutting table I got yellow canvas on it and my van was yellow, white and black.\" \"Those three colours exemplified everything I did in my upholstery shop, so when I changed that from Third Man Upholstery to Third Man Records, I kept those same colours.\" \"It's almost like a safety colour, yellow, it's a powerful colour, not as powerful as red, but a very powerful, enticing colour, that comes from, 'watch out, be careful, there's danger here', [that] kind of an idea. \"And I wanted to exemplify in the uniform of the people that work here that we're all tools for creativity.\" It was good to meet Jack White. Long before I was a political journalist I had interviewed many musicians and most were a disappointment. It taught me early on that you can like someone's art without liking them. I had worried that White would be glib and pretentious. He's anything but. He's thoughtful, eager to explain, playful and endearingly humble when praised. And he's passionate about his desire to inject meaning into everything he does. It is perhaps this thirst that is behind his passion for vinyl. Third Man's reception area doubles as a small record store where you can flip through LPs in racks. He has his own albums made at a plant about a mile down the road. You can watch as one by one the discs are pressed and the edges shaved off. Long drooping coils of red or black vinyl fall into a bin. It is mass production but it takes minutes, not seconds. I say to him that all those years ago when I was young, buying an album was a complete experience: not just packaging for the music but an expression of a band's intention with artwork that you could hold in your hands, lyrics and liner notes to read. \"Yeah you've got it. I mean it's the romance,\" he says, adding: \"I mean to have a song digitally, it's portable and you can listen to it in your car, you can put it in a CD player, your iPod and you can have it at your fingertips, that's a nice thing. \"But it's only one aspect of the entire romantic picture you could have with a vinyl record. Large artwork, the smell of vinyl, the smell of the newly opened record, and the lyrics and whatever the artist wanted to intend for you to see while you're experience it.\" \"You had the large artwork and you had good sound quality, and a romantic experience of putting down a needle and watching something revolve, which is very important. I think a lot of people don't realise that. If we don't see something moving, we lose romance.\" Why is movement romantic? \"I think it's like a caveman watching a campfire,\" he says. \"You can't stop looking at it. Why? It's fire, we know what it is, we've seen it a million times, big deal. That movement is just hypnotising to us and I think it's relaxing. \"Just like white noise can put us to sleep I think the movement of a turntable or even a cassette it makes us think, 'OK, things are happening and I'm part of this'.\" It must be a hypnotic experience watching a special vinyl edition of his new album, Blunderbuss, go round and round. It has a pale blue lightening flash running through it. It's his first solo album, and he says it was odd to be in charge, not part of a band. \"It's also strange to produce your own song... without a band,\" he says. I produced my own music before but in a band context where I didn't really tell the other people in the band what to play.\" But collaborating helped. \"A lot of people were all playing on this record and getting thrown into positions of songs that they wouldn't normally play.\" \"A clarinet player played the organ on one song. She's never played that instrument in her life.\" While the album moves seamlessly from rock-n-roll to waltz, it is a riot of styles with a basic recipe: hard rock and acoustically driven Americana, mixed in judiciously different quantity. But, apparently, not by design. \"What I wish people would know about me is that it always starts from the song, one song at a time,\" he says. \"They each have their own personality and I treat them each like they're an A-side of a single.\" I am struck by the imagery of violence in his love songs. In one he compares a relationship to being dismembered slowly, body part by body part. In another, love is like a knife twisting slowly that \"turns friends into enemies\". I ask him if romance is an emotionally violent experience for him. \"It has to be, it's not easy, it's not easy like winning a lottery ticket,\" he says. \"It's work, it's fortunate, you're fortunate to experience any of it, and it's beautiful when it begins and it's beautiful when it ends, too.\" Is he in love at the moment? \"Always, always in love.\"", "question": "For a man who can pump out such blistering , no - nonsense post - punk hard rock , the @placeholder of the more mannered art - school rocker hangs thickly around Jack White .", "option_0": "shadow", "option_1": "presence", "option_2": "identity", "option_3": "air", "option_4": "gloss", "label": 3}
{"article": "It is easy to dismiss Tuesday's lengthy (8 hours, 24 minutes) meeting of Labour's national executive committee as a festival of navel-gazing, but there is a lot more at stake. The idea that Wales should have its own seat on the NEC has been around for some time. Alun Michael used it as part of his Welsh Labour leadership campaign in 1988. It will now happen, but only after a close vote and a long debate over how the Welsh representative should be chosen. He or she will now be a \"frontbench\" member of the Welsh Assembly, chosen by the party leader in Wales. (Carwyn Jones can currently attend NEC meetings but has no voting rights). The vote was close - 16 to 15 - because supporters of Jeremy Corbyn thought it better that the Welsh rep be chosen by rank-and-file members who might be more in tune with his philosophy than someone chosen by the Welsh party leadership. Welsh Labour will also now take responsibility for its own elections, so the electoral college is likely to survive. One member one vote, with supporters able to pay to take part, is widely seen as key to the election of Jeremy Corbyn and few in the Welsh Labour hierarchy want to repeat the experiment when Carwyn Jones moves on. The leader of Welsh Labour will also get the right to attend \"Clause V\" meetings, where the Labour general election manifesto is signed off. And the Welsh executive will \"administer the procedure and selection of Westminster parliamentary candidates in Wales\". It's not clear whether that includes by-elections, where candidates have often been shortlisted by the NEC. But it could be significant with proposed boundary changes likely to mean some sitting Labour MPs going head-to-head for their own job. Some MPs fear that Corbyn supporters will try to deselect them before the next election in what they would describe as a purge and others see as wider democracy in constituencies with growing memberships under the current leader. Again, it's unclear whether devolving powers to Cardiff would have any impact. The changes add up to a more federal structure within Labour and \"parity\" with Scottish Labour, although its leader, Kezia Dugdale, says it will now have the power to make policy in reserved (i.e. not devolved) areas too. In other news, the polls have closed in the Labour leadership election, with Owen Smith doing little to fuel optimism among his supporters that he might win:   \"I won't be serving in Jeremy's cabinet but I will do what I've always done which is be Labour, vote Labour loyally serve this party, make sure that from back benches I continue to make the arguments I've made during this campaign.\" The election result will be declared on Saturday ahead of the Labour conference in Liverpool, where the changes to Labour's internal machinery are expected to be approved by delegates.", "question": "As a political anorak , I @placeholder to few in my fascination with the internal rulebook of political parties .

{"article": "The agreement would have meant an Orange parade, prevented from returning to Ligoniel on July 12, 2013, would have been completed on Friday morning. A loyalist protest camp at Twaddell Avenue would then have been dismantled. The deal was to be announced on Monday, but a press conference was cancelled. The Crumlin and Ardoyne Residents Association (CARA), the residents group involved in the talks, held a public meeting on Monday night to outline details of the proposed agreement. Afterwards, some of those who attended said they were opposed to the deal, but believe it will go ahead. Members of CARA then held a private meeting to discuss the feedback and agree the next step. A statement is expected to be issued later. It is understood discussions involving loyalists and Orange Order members are also taking place. Sources told the BBC that opinion about the proposal among those at the meeting was divided. Two nationalist MLAs for north Belfast who attended the meeting said they hoped a resolution to the dispute could be found. \"The mood of tonight's meeting is that this could be an extraordinary moment, but people are very, very worried, they want to come to a conclusion,\" said Sinn FÃ©in MLA Gerry Kelly. \"CARA outlined proposals that were brought forward by two facilitators, they have given an update about where it is at the moment and they have taken soundings, listened to people. There were many different opinions in there.\" Mr Kelly said CARA now faces a difficult decision and that he will support whatever they decide. SDLP MLA Nicola Mallon said the meeting had been told that one of the three Orange lodges involved in the dispute has said it would not support the proposed agreement. \"Tonight was the first time that many people have had a chance to look at those details and to consider them,\" she said. \"Certainly a lot of people had a lot of questions to  ask and have asked that CARA goes away and reflects on their views and comes back.\" The deal between CARA and the Orange Order also included a moratorium on future parades that pass a contested section of the route past the Ardoyne shop fronts on the Crumlin Road. Under the terms of the deal, CARA would not object to five morning parades by the Orange Order and the Apprentice Boys. In return, the Loyal Orders had agreed not to apply for permission for return evening parades, including on the Twelfth, until agreement could be reached. The agreement would be hugely significant, but it does not have universal support. Another nationalist residents group, the Greater Ardoyne Residents Collective (GARC), has made it clear that it is opposed to the deal. In recent days, members of one of three Orange lodges involved in the parades dispute have not backed the agreement. Ballysillan LOL 1891 has said it would not take part in the parade back to Ligoniel on Friday morning. That caused concern on the nationalist side that any agreement would not stick and that some members of the Orange Order might continue the protest. The loyalist protest at Twaddell Avenue began in July 2013 after a Parades Commission determination not to allow a return leg of an Orange parade to pass a section of the Crumlin road.

He withstood some excellent South Africa bowling, particularly from Vernon Philander, who took 2-17. England gave Test debuts to three players, with Tom Westley making 25 and Dawid Malan one. Pace bowler Toby Roland-Jones is included in a bowling attack that is without left-arm spinner Liam Dawson, who was omitted to make way for an extra batsman. Rain arrived before lunch, during tea and finally, just after 18:00 BST. The four-match series is level at 1-1. Media playback is not supported on this device Following a heavy defeat in the second Test at Trent Bridge, England's batsmen came in for some fierce criticism for a cavalier approach that is often not suited to the longest form of the game. Here, they all looked to apply themselves, with Cook giving a perfect demonstration of the judgement, grit and patience that has made him England's all-time leading run-scorer. The left-hander only played the ball when necessary, often leaving on length, scoring with tickles off the pads and pushes square on the off side. He added 52 with Essex team-mate Westley, 49 with captain Joe Root and an unbeaten 51 with Ben Stokes, who remains on 21. With the match evenly poised, England will look to the former skipper to push on to a 31st Test century and well beyond on Friday. Media playback is not supported on this device What made Cook's knock all the more impressive was the examination provided by the South Africa pace attack on a green-tinged pitch that offered just enough assistance. Philander managed only four overs in the morning session because of a stomach upset, but still had Keaton Jennings caught at third slip for nought. The opener has now made three ducks in nine Test innings. Morne Morkel tormented Root after lunch, but it was Philander who struck, a wonderful delivery matched by the one-handed catch of diving wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. However, it was Kagiso Rabada who produced the moment of the day, a searing inswinging yorker that bowled Malan off his pads. Right-hander Westley, given an opportunity at number three after Gary Ballance broke a finger, was at the crease in only the fourth over and looked at home in Test cricket. Strong off the pads, he followed Cook's example to leave well outside off stump. He fell after lunch, loosely driving at Chris Morris to be caught at third slip. Middlesex's Malan, a left-hander, endured a more difficult day, taking 15 deliveries to get off the mark. But he was in no way to blame for his dismissal, with Rabada's toe-crushing pace virtually unplayable. Media playback is not supported on this device Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS: \"Malan got an 88mph yorker, which is always difficult, but I do think he gets a bit shut off. \"That front foot can just be opened a little bit to get in a better alignment because clearly he is going to get that ball again in the second innings. \"I can't see Jennings opening in Australia this winter but I saw him in Mumbai and thought he could play. \"Clearly he is low in confidence and I don't see him walking out at Brisbane but you never say never.

{"article": "He runs the Hook and Cleaver butcher in Ealing, west London. \"At the time trade really did go through the roof, especially with mince products, burgers, sausages, things like that,\" he says. Consumers had lost confidence in some supermarket products and favoured local butchers like Mr Dzido who could tell them more about the meat they were buying. The scandal emerged in mid-January, when Irish food inspectors announced they had found traces of horsemeat in some frozen beefburgers stocked by UK supermarkets including Tesco, Iceland and Lidl. Over the next few months a number of stores and suppliers across the UK and Europe had to remove products labelled as beef after test results revealed they contained varying quantities of horsemeat - in some cases up to 100%. As a result sales of frozen burgers and frozen ready meals plunged. The most dramatic decline came in March and April of last year when frozen burger sales tumbled 41% compared with the same months in 2012, according to figures from industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel. Frozen ready meals also saw a sharp drop in sales, falling 11% in March and 15% in April. But since that panic the frozen burger has made a comeback. For the 12 weeks to 8 December 2013, burger sales were down just 1% compared with the same period in 2012. The reason? Heavy discounting. Food retailers, including Iceland, discounted burgers after the crisis and shoppers found that hard to resist, particularly at a time when many households were struggling with tighter budgets. \"If something is out there at half price you get huge spikes in sales, people immediately react to that,\" says Ed Garner, communications director at Kantar Worldpanel. However, frozen ready meals have not seen the same kind of recovery. The most recent figures show sales still down 6% compared with a year ago. Analysts say that is probably because shoppers were uncertain about the quality of frozen ready meals, even before the horsemeat scandal broke. \"People were already predisposed to suspect frozen foods were somehow inferior,\" says Mr Garner. \"It kind of confirmed matters when people saw that a frozen ready meal turned out to be all horse and no meat.\" As well as affecting sales, the horsemeat scandal has changed the way some customers shop for food. An Ipsos Mori poll run in partnership with the Grocer magazine shows that almost a third of respondents said the incident had \"permanently impacted\" the way they chose and bought food. And a survey carried out on behalf consumer organisation Which? in late November found that 49% of respondents said the horsemeat incident had changed their shopping habits, with 25% saying they bought less processed meat and 17% saying they bought more products from butchers and farmers' markets. And it seems that value for money is still the main concern for many shoppers. \"Twenty-six per cent of the British public are buying cheaper food than they were a year ago, which may suggest that price is still a central factor in food choices,\" says Stephen Yap, head of Ipsos MarketQuest. According to the Ipsos Mori poll, Tesco and Iceland suffered more damage to their reputations from the incident than other supermarket chains. Ipsos Mori asked if people felt more or less favourable towards the six major UK supermarkets after the incident. In response, 20% of those polled said they felt less favourably about Tesco, and 14% felt less favourably about Iceland. But both chains would probably point to the fact that almost 70% of respondents \"felt the same\" about them. A Tesco spokesperson told the BBC: \"The horsemeat issue impacted customer confidence across the retail industry. In response to the issue, we promised our customers we would make significant changes, and we have done so. \"We take nothing for granted and will continue to work hard to ensure customers know our food is of the highest quality.\" Iceland did not respond to a BBC enquiry. Retailers have been working hard to regain trust, according to industry body the British Retail Consortium: \"Over the last 12 months suppliers have been reassessed, supply chains are less complex including an increase in sourcing from the UK, there has been an increase in the unannounced audits of suppliers, and increased testing of ingredients.\" Back in Ealing, Mr Dzido is proud of the fact that he travels to Smithfield meat market and personally selects the meat sold in his shop. \"We offer a bit more than supermarkets do.

Democrats fear that the commission may be used to justify tightening voting procedures - changes which could make certain groups less likely to vote. The groups most affected by so-called voter suppression tend to vote Democrat. But it is not just Democrats who are opposed to the collection of such data by the federal government. Mississippi's Secretary of State, Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, said in an official statement that his reply to the commission would be \"they can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great state to launch from\". Mr Trump set up the commission to investigate claims - unsubstantiated, but which he repeats - that millions of fraudulent votes cost him the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. He secured more votes in the all-important electoral college than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, thus winning the presidency. Mr Trump established the Presidential Advisory commission on Election Integrity in May, despite evidence that voter fraud is not a widespread problem in the US.

{"article": "In two experiments, teams of researchers managed to attach tracking and sound-recording tags to 17 blue whales and two beaked whales. They then played simulated sonar sound through an underwater speaker and measured the animals' responses. The findings are reported in two Royal Society journals, Proceedings B and Biology Letters. Researchers have previously linked mass strandings and deaths of beaked whales around the world to military exercises using what is known as mid-frequency sonar. So scientists have been keen to understand if the sound harmed the animals. The new study does not explain those strandings - the chain of events that leads to these remains unclear. But marine mammal expert Patrick Miller, from the University of St Andrews' Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU), who was not involved with the new study, said the results showed it would be wise for naval exercises to \"avoid critical habitat areas\". The beaked whale study was led by scientists also from the SMRU. It revealed what researchers had long suspected, that man-made sound had a negative effect on these deep-diving whales. Beaked whales use sound to hunt as well as to communicate. They produce echolocation clicks as they dive up to 1.5km (1mi) in depth, picking up echoes that bounce off the bodies of the squid they are hunting. When the scientists played the sonar sounds during their experiments, both of the tagged Cuvier's beaked whales stopped hunting and \"swam rapidly, silently away\". Perhaps more surprising was that, in the other study, led by Jeremy Goldbogen from the Cascadia Research Collective in the US state of Washington, several blue whales also responded to the sound. Blue whales communicate with very low-frequency sound - far below that of naval sonar. And because they do not use sound to hunt, the scientists thought they would not be affected. Yet the whales' responses did vary. Animals that were feeding close to the surface showed almost no response, but animals that were diving for krill - rather than sifting the surface waters - reacted very differently. \"One animal was diving and feeding repeatedly all throughout the day,\" recalled Dr Goldbogen. \"And as soon as the sound started, the animal stopped feeding and maintained a directed heading and moved away from the sound source.\" These vast animals can scoop up half a million calories' worth of krill in one gulp as they dive, so disturbing their feeding deprives them of large amounts of energy. \"I calculated that in that time, the animal lost a metric tonne of krill,\" said Dr Goldbogen. \"So if this happens a lot in these feeding hotspots, that could have real consequences.\" And currently, naval exercises are carried out in these hotspots. The blue whales in this study, for example, were feeding in the in-shore waters of California during the summer and autumn of 2010. The study area is where the US Navy carries out regular exercises and where the whales come to build up fat stores for the long migration to their breeding grounds. Even subtle disturbance to this vital pre-migration gorge, said Dr Goldbogen, \"could have real consequences for the population health\". \"These are the biggest animals that have ever lived, so they need a huge amount of food,\" he added. The detailed examination of the whales' behaviour was made possible by the technology contained within the tracking tags. See inside a blue whale How do whale species live for 200 years? Hear humpback whale mating calls \"A lot of the same sensors that are in our smartphones are in the tags we attached to these whales,\" said Dr Goldbogen. \"When you rotate your phone and the screen moves with you, that's because there are these sensors called accelerometers and magnetometers. \"That's how we get the information about the position of the whale.\" This resulted in detailed animations of each whale's position, speed and movement. But to actually put a tag onto one of these giant mammals involved a chase. The tags are attached using suction cups, so the researchers had to use a small boat to move alongside each whale, while one member of the team used a long carbon fibre pole to \"tap\" the tag onto the animal's back. \"It's a lot easier in blue whales than some other whales, because they're so big,\" said Dr Goldbogen. \"We can programme the tag to release, so we find the tag and download the data.\" This is a far trickier exercise with beaked whales, which are smaller and dive for an hour at a time. \"If you see a beaked whale and if you don't get the tag on it, you might never see it again,\" said Dr Goldbogen. Although both studies provide clear evidence that sonar affects these rare marine mammals, the scientists say much more research is needed into the specific impacts of human activity on their environment. Dr Miller commented: \"Further research on the possible long-term impacts of these effects is needed, to evaluate whether more protection measures are required.\" Dr Goldbogen concluded: \"We didn't expect blue whales to have a strong response, so there's clearly a dearth of basic data on how animals respond to man-made sound. \"These animals have evolved in a very different environment to the one they're living in today.\"", "question": "Blue and beaked whales ' behaviour is disturbed by simulated navy sonar , according to two @placeholder studies .", "option_0": "body", "option_1": "sources", "option_2": "published", "option_3": "struggling", "option_4": "neighbours", "label": 2}
{"article": "Comic founder and writer Pat Mills and artist Kevin O'Neill have co-written Serial Killer, the first in a planned series of books. Mills started his career with Dundee-based publisher DC Thomson in the 70s. He said Scots he met during his time there and later while working in London inspired the novel's character, Joy. While at DC Thomson, Mills worked on the publisher's girls' titles Romeo and Jackie. After he left the Dundee publisher, he created the girls' mystery comic Misty and co-created the war stories comic Battle and science-fiction/fantasy comic 2000AD, which is 40 years old this year. With O'Neill, who illustrated 2000AD's Nemesis the Warlock stories and Alan Moore's famous graphic novel The Extraordinary League of Gentlemen, Mills has written Serial Killer, the first in a series of novels entitled Read Em and Weep. Mills said: \"The novels are set in the eccentric 'Life on Mars' world that was the 1970s and features classic 1970s comics, including fictional versions of Battle, Action and 2000AD. \"It's a story of revenge for a lost childhood, of flawed and eccentric characters, strange passions and arrested development.\" Joy, a journalist, is one of the book's main characters. Mills said: \"She's inspired by a number of female journalists I worked with at DC Thomson as well as Scottish women I know in London. \"One chapter in the novel comes to mind. It was inspired by a time when I worked on Romeo. \"The female journalists on Romeo and Jackie were quite outraged by the awful female hygiene products that were being aimed at teenage girls. This would have been in the early 70s. \"I'm pretty certain they won and the adverts were withdrawn which is admirable. The products quoted in the chapter of the novel, though fictional, are close to reality. \"What was difficult on teenage magazines was how to handle real teenage girl problems and I recall the editor of the Romeo problem page telling me that she wasn't allowed to deal with serious issues and she found that very frustrating. Once again, Joy mirrors this subject.\" Mills also recalls how working at DC Thomson gave him a \"love of popular culture which has stayed with me my entire life\". Describing Scotland as having a \"supportive atmosphere\" for comics, he said he found DC Thomson's comic strips \"so much funnier\" than other mainstream British comic publishers. Among those who made the comics funny was the late Manchester-born artist Ken Reid, the inspiration for another character in Serial Killer. Mills said: \"DC Thomson's fun comics were so much funnier than others and Kevin and I tackle that subject with gusto in another chapter. \"We mention Ken Reid - referred to as Ken Royce - who was a protÃ©gÃ© of DC Thomson and was behind comic characters Jonah and Rodger the Dodger. \"Both Kevin and I are huge admirers of his wonderfully subversive material which I do think has a Scottish satirical, almost dour, element.\"", "question": "Women working in Scotland 's publishing industry @placeholder the writing of a character in a new novel by two legends of British comic books .", "option_0": "claimed", "option_1": "surrounding", "option_2": "enjoyed", "option_3": "influenced", "option_4": "owes", "label": 3}

{"article": "Unlike gangs in Europe or Canada who largely hold territory so that they can control the illegal drug markets in that area, US gangs see holding territory as an end in-and-of-itself. \"They're very territorial,\" Mr Falco said. \"It's all over claiming territory or states\". The Bandidos, one of the gangs involved in the shootout on Sunday, control Texas as part of their group's territory, he said. Members of other gangs can usually pass through or even live in Texas with little trouble, as long as they do not sport a Texas \"bottom rocker\" - a patch on the lower part of a biker's vest that shows which state the gang member is claiming. The Cossacks, who were also involved in the shooting, started as a family biker club, he said. Over time, however, their ranks grew and they began wearing the Texas bottom rocker in an act of rebellion against the Bandidos. \"It's just to say they're the biggest gang on the block,\" Mr Falco said. \"They want to keep expanding, and growing, and claiming that area as their own, and kicking out the other biker gang that might control that area.\" Mr Falco said that a lot of the violent gang members were formerly in the military, and the gangs themselves have strict military-like features. \"A biker gang is highly structured - military style structure - with a ton of rules, regulations, and built as a war machine\". The men who make up these gangs are usually older and have better training in fighting than members of other types of gangs. \"They're much more sophisticated in turning out a war,\" he said. \"A lot of these clubs started - were World War II vets or Vietnam vets - and now a lot of clubs have started based around guys returning from Afghanistan and Iraq.  So you're having an influx of new biker gangs.\" The Bandidos are no exception and formed in Texas during the Vietnam War era. Mr Falco said joining or creating a biker gang allows a small set of \"anti-social\" veterans who \"love-war\" to live out their combat fantasies. Joining is not quick or easy. The exact process of initiation varies in length and procedure from gang to gang, but they usually require inductees to go through several steps to prove their loyalty, according to Mr Falco. The current gang members often invite newcomers - called hang-arounds - to their club houses and parties. At these parties the newcomer is expected to serve drinks and carry out other menial tasks to show their loyalty. Overtime, as trust is built, the hang-around is made a prospect. \"When you prospect you get the vest, but you only get the bottom rocker,\" Mr Falco explained. \"You don't get the patch or anything that says the name of the club.\" The prospect is still required to conduct many of the humiliating tasks that newcomers are required to do, but wearing the vest allows current gang members to see how the prospect conducts himself while in uniform. \"They're going to see how you deal with the police,\" he said. \"Once you start wearing those vests... the cops are going to start messing with you.\" After further trust building, the prospect becomes a bonafide gang member. The exact procedure for this transition varies between gangs, with some requiring a consensus vote by all members and others needing only local validation. While many seek the comfort and security that gang affiliation might purport to provide, inductees often find that gang membership brings on a new set of insecurities. Vigilance is constantly required, Mr Falco said. Members keep tabs on rival gangs and on potential moles within their own ranks. Betrayal and backstabbing run rife, as members compete for power both within the gang and against other gangs. \"They're jockeying for power, one minute you have power, once you lose it everyone leaves you,\" he said. \"Some of the guys are very likable, some of them have generosity towards each other, and you think 'Oh that's really nice',\" he said. \"In reality that's all for themselves, so that they have that power, so that they have that belonging.\"", "question": "The recent gun battle in Texas has put a spotlight on violent biker gangs in the US .

{"article": "More say over energy, transport and the assembly's own elections are on offer. But a report said the draft Wales Bill was \"constricting\" the assembly, by the way it was reserving many matters as the responsibility of Westminster. Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said he was open to changes amid accusations the bill may reduce Welsh power. It proposes moving to a \"reserved powers\" model for Wales, by which all policy areas are assumed to be devolved unless specified as remaining with the UK government. Opposition parties have claimed the list of reservations is too long. Monday's report from Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre and University College London (UCL) said the UK government's latest devolution proposals were \"clunky and short-sighted\". Professor Richard Rawlings from UCL said Wales had experienced \"three deeply problematic devolution settlements\" since 1999, and there had been hopes of a process putting Welsh devolution on a \"sustainable constitutional basis\". But he warned: \"The draft Wales Bill does not do what was promised. \"All too often, the Secretary of State's fine policy objectives of a stronger, clearer, fairer and more robust devolution settlement are frustrated by provision that is constricting, clunky, inequitable and constitutionally short-sighted. Prof Rawlings said the assembly faced a \"triple squeeze\" of \"intrusive general restriction, over-occupation of legislative space, and blurry forms of executive veto\". MPs on the Welsh Affairs Committee have been carrying out their own inquiry and are expected to publish a report soon. A spokesman for the Wales Office said: \"We want the Wales Bill to create a stronger Wales within a strong United Kingdom and we published a draft bill so that we could listen to comments and make sure we get this right. \"Clearly before publishing the full bill we have to wait for the Welsh Affairs Committee to publish its report, and then give due consideration to its recommendations.\" A Welsh government spokesperson said Monday's report backed the first minister's assertion that the draft Bill was \"too important to be rushed\". \"We urge the UK government to delay introduction of the Bill and take the time needed to get this right, with proper engagement between UK and Welsh governments and other stakeholders,\" the spokesperson added. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said Monday's report echoed many of her party's concerns. \"The only way of securing a robust and sustainable devolution settlement is to give Wales parity with the other nations of the UK,\" she said. \"At present, Scotland and Northern Ireland are being handed significant tax powers while English cities will gain control over policing - all of this without a referendum. \"Time and again, Wales is forced to jump through more hoops than any other part of the UK, only to end up with less control over our own affairs.\" By the standards of the usual dry constitutional language associated with reports like this, there was some eye-catching criticism here.

{"article": "It has always ended like that, wherever he has been. Media playback is not supported on this device But if England have failed in their attempts to manage him, then so has everyone else. At least the decision not to pick him again was unanimous and made by those at the England and Wales Cricket Board who know what really went on. It has been made by people within the dressing room, not by journalists or supporters. Players have said various things off the record about Pietersen and his behaviour, but when a camera or dictaphone is put in front of them they will tell you what a great lad he is. On the field of play, he may have been England's leading run scorer in the 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia, but he dug deep and fought only once, when he scored 71 and 49 at Melbourne. If he had averaged 40 and been caught behind every time, then he may have survived. However, the way he got out in the first three Tests in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth will have played a big part in the decision taken by the ECB. Pietersen has always batted however he feels on a particular day, but if he could not get his head down and play for the team when they were up against it, could he ever do so? His international career could easily have ended 18 months ago when he sent text messages to the South Africa dressing room, undermining then captain Andrew Strauss. That was shameful - and Pietersen knew it. The ECB did all it could to bring him back on board, but when you have been so completely and utterly dismantled, as England have been this winter, you have to draw a line.

And he is exactly right. Teams sometimes get too settled, get stuck in their ways and lose sight of what they are there to do. It is not about being the greatest team in the world ever, it is about fighting for every run and wicket. That is what you have to get back to. England need players like Durham's Ben Stokes, who is young, hungry and ambitious. They must work really hard to build up a team again, especially after team director Andy Flower's resignation last week. Only those close to the team can decide whether Pietersen would have bought into that - and they clearly thought he would not. The England management could have told him he would not feature in the limited-overs tour of the West Indies and the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh that follows, but that if he got his head down and scored some runs in county cricket then the route back was possible. That would have placed the emphasis on him. If he wanted to reach that 10,000-Test run landmark that he talked about and if he wanted to work under a new coach, that would have been in his power. That was the option I thought the ECB would take. I will remember Pietersen as possibly the most entertaining, brilliant and unorthodox batsman I have ever seen. Some of the shots he played were things that not even West Indies great Viv Richards - my idol growing up - would have played. It is very easy to say that Pietersen has not fulfilled his potential - he averaged less than 50 in Test cricket and missed out on the 10,000 Test runs he should have scored - but much of the disappointment that people feel towards him is similar to the way people felt about David Gower. People would complain about Gower playing another loose shot outside off stump, but often that was because they had wanted to watch him at the crease for a little longer.

{"article": "Officially the Grateful Dead had no leader. But from the band's origins in 1965 to his death 30 years later, Garcia was the best known member of a group which still evokes the excitement of American counterculture in the 1960s. As well as '60s psychedelia, the group's albums show the influence of jazz, bluegrass, mainstream pop and even their early days as a jug band.  But when they toured it was the lengthy jam sessions fans loved - and central to those was the Garcia guitar sound. Devoted Deadheads identify five classic guitars which Garcia played at different times: Alligator, Rosebud, Lightning Bolt, Tiger and Wolf. The last two were auctioned together in 2002 and made more than $1.5m (£1.2m).  Now Wolf is back at the same auction house to benefit the advocacy group the Southern Poverty Law Center. Arlan Ettinger runs Guernsey's auction house in New York which is handling this month's sale. Guernsey's specialises in the unusual.  \"I've loved having a pioneering sale of John F Kennedy memorabilia or jazz artefacts,\" says Ettinger. \"But selling Tiger and Wolf the first time round was a huge thrill because real fans are amazingly passionate about the Grateful Dead. It's like they've become the ultimate rock icon of '60s America and all that excitement and the passion that went with it.\" Tiger was bought in 2002 by the hugely wealthy Jim Irsay, who owns the National Football League (NFL) team the Indianapolis Colts.  Wolf went for more than $700,000 (£543,000) to Dan Pritzker, whose family founded the Hyatt hotel chain. Ettinger remembers there had already been a lot of press interest in who owned the guitars. \"They were consigned to Guernsey's by the man who made them - the luthier [guitar maker] Doug Irwin.  In his will Jerry had bequeathed the guitars back to Doug but the band members challenged that legally. Times had been tough for Doug Irwin and he had at times been homeless. \"Everyone was saying they were worth maybe $25,000 (£19,000) or $50,000 (£39,000) apiece.  But we built a big auction of Grateful Dead material around them and we proved they were worth a lot more. The auction was at the ultra-hip disco Studio 54 in Manhattan which made it pretty special. \"So I was surprised and delighted when Dan Pritzker got back in contact to say all these years later he wants to auction Wolf again for charity.  Dan is intent that every dollar of the hammer price should go to the Law Center and we've agreed to that. \"Given what it sold for in 2002 and given how great a cause this is, we're hoping the Center will get more than $1.5m (£1.2m) from the sale this month.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center was founded in Alabama in 1971 to focus on civil rights. Ettinger thinks Garcia would be delighted to see it benefit from the sale of Wolf. \"Southern Poverty has fought racism and hate groups and neo-Nazis through the courts. So I thought it was a noble thing for Dan Pritzker to do.  It's a pure gift with no tax write-off and there's no seller's commission for us. \"Dan told me he was deeply troubled by the direction our new government is taking.  He wanted to take some proactive steps to do something important and good with the money the auction will raise.\" The guitar's Wolf association came about almost by accident: it wasn't something Irwin included when he made the instrument. Garcia stuck a cartoon wolf on the guitar as a joke. At one point the instrument went back to Irwin for repairs and he decided to incorporate the cartoon wolf more permanently. Ettinger thinks only the most obsessive Deadheads can identify exactly which guitar Garcia played in each recording. \"But the Wolf design means you can often pick out that exact instrument at a particular concert in photographs and film footage. \"There is so much interest still in Jerry and the band. There's a new Martin Scorsese six-part TV series about them: I think that will tell us about the world they lived in, not just about their music. \"It's funny when you think of the guitar as just wood and strips of metal and wire strings.  But it takes people back to very important moments in their lives.

{"article": "Instead, hundreds of photographers and men turned up for the event on Rio de Janeiro's Ipanema beach. More than 2,000 women had said they would take their tops off on the beach on Saturday morning to call for the law to be scrapped. Organisers say most women probably felt too intimidated to join the protest. Protesters say Brazilian legislation, which defines beach topless as an obscene act, is anachronistic and hypocritical. They argue that nudity is tolerated during the annual carnival parade in Rio. \"It's a false-Puritanism and indicative of our macho culture that we have a law forbidding that a woman can go topless,\" Olga Salon told the Associated Press news agency. She was one of the few women who went ahead with the protest and took her top off before a crowd of photographers and male beach-goers. The organiser, Ana Rios, said the idea was to raise awareness to the prejudice against women in Brazil. \"It is a pity it became a media circus. What really amazes me is the number of men who came here just to see women's chests,\" she said. The movement began after Brazilian actress Cristina Flores was approached by local policemen during a photo session. She says they threatened to arrest her if she did not agree to put her top on. \"I didn't even know it was illegal when I did it,\" she said. A 1940s law says going topless on the beach is punishable with three months to a year in jail or a fine.

{"article": "Most migrants were said to have relocated to accommodation in refitted shipping containers but some moved their tents further inside the camp. Authorities want to clear the area next to a motorway for security reasons. Riot police have been overseeing the operation which seemed to be happening without incident. The move is part of a new housing project in attempts to improve conditions in the camp, which is used by about 5,000 migrants and refugees. The 125 converted containers are equipped with electricity, heating and bunk beds, and each one can accommodate 12 people. Officials had given between 1,000 and 1,500 residents until last Thursday to leave the area, but they were reportedly given a grace period until Monday. But many migrants and refugees had refused to use the new accommodation and moved their temporary homes further inside the camp, despite poor living conditions. Many reportedly feared they could be permanently trapped at the new camp, unable to continue their attempts to cross to the UK. Some also expressed their unhappiness about leaving an area where they have established a community, and are concerned about their future treatment by the authorities. \"This (the container camp) is the same as a jail.

{"article": "Russian MPs have backed a bill to ban \"undesirable\" foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or firms. The draft leaves the definition of \"undesirable\" open to interpretation. Under an existing 2012 law, foreign-funded Russian NGOs linked to politics must register as \"foreign agents\". The label has connotations of spying. A party loyal to President Vladimir Putin drafted the new law. His supporters dominate both houses of parliament. The text going through the Duma - Russia's lower house - says it will be up to Russian prosecutors and the foreign ministry to decide if a foreign organisation or firm is \"undesirable\". A foreigner declared \"undesirable\" could face a fine of up to 500,000 roubles (Â£6,343; $10,000) and up to six years in jail. The bill passed a second reading in the Duma on Friday. It still requires a third reading, then approval by the upper house (Federation Council) and President Putin to become law. In most cases that is a formality. The legislation comes amid frosty relations between Russia and the West, characterised by sanctions and counter-sanctions over Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The BBC's Yuri Vendik in Moscow says the legislation opens up foreign firms to potential prosecution, because it does not include the word \"non-commercial\" in the text. The MP who drafted it, Alexander Tarnavsky of the party A Just Russia, said he wanted foreign businesses to be covered by the law. \"Unfortunately some foreign organisations for various reasons are working against Russia. \"They may be ideological reasons, or in the interests of shareholders, or economic interests, it's normal for them to say: 'Come on, let's push Russia down, so the value of Russian shares goes down, and then we'll buy them,'\" he told the BBC. 'Pressure on foreigners' - Yuri Vendik, BBC Russian: This law is a way of strengthening pressure on foreigners - it can be seen as a political step. It doesn't give any criteria to define \"undesirable\", so it is not clear which organisations could be affected - the language is not precise. In theory they can punish whoever they like - businesses, media organisations. Or it could be an oil firm, or someone in the financial sphere. Non-governmental organisations are not clearly defined in Russian law. The text has been finished - there won't be more amendments now. But there might be a procedural delay before the Duma's third and final reading. Pavel Chikov, head of a human rights umbrella group called Agora, said: \"Simply declaring someone 'undesirable, we don't want to see him on our territory' will be a violation of international law and general legal principles, and of the civil legal code.\" He predicted \"a mass of disputes over interpretation of the law\". In a commentary on the draft law, the popular Russian daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said the \"undesirable\" label could be applied to any foreign organisation, \"commercial and non-profit alike\". It said NGOs such as Medecins Sans Frontieres, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Reporters Without Borders and Transparency International \"are certainly under threat\". It described the new law as a \"weapon\" that could be used \"next time relations with the West escalate, or under the influence of paranoid 'anti-Maidan' nightmares\" - referring to Russian fears of a Ukraine-style popular revolt against the government.", "question": "Russia plans to introduce new @placeholder to prosecute foreigners whose activities are seen as \" undesirable \" on national security grounds .", "option_0": "laws", "option_1": "team", "option_2": "powers", "option_3": "deals", "option_4": "measures", "label": 2}

{"article": "Opposition parties and human rights groups say this would erode the independence of the judiciary. The governing Law and Justice party says the reforms are needed because the judiciary is corrupt and serves only the elite. The bill must now be signed by the president in order to become law. A demonstration against the changes is scheduled to take place in the capital Warsaw on Sunday. Since it came to power in 2015, the government of the conservative, populist Law and Justice party (PiS), has passed a series of controversial reforms, triggering mass protests. Polish senators backed the legislation in a vote in the early hours of Saturday morning. Earlier this week, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro had argued that the changes were necessary because the current system of appointing judges was undemocratic. \"We want to end corporatism and introduce the oxygen of democracy there. Because Poland is a democracy based on the rule of law. \"This is not court-ocracy,\" the minister said. But opposition parties are concerned that the law would give parliament - dominated by PiS lawmakers - a greater say  in appointing judges, violating the constitutional separation of powers. The legislation will now go to President Andrzej Duda for signing. He has given no indication he plans to veto it. A separate bill was also presented in parliament this week, which would allow the justice minister to get rid of all of Poland's Supreme Court judges and appoint new ones. This piece of legislation was not consulted beforehand and introduced to parliament in the middle of the night, reports the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw. Under the PiS government, the justice minister already wields considerable power over the prosecution service in his role as prosecutor general because he can influence prosecutors to launch investigations, our correspondent says. Grzegorz Schetyna, who leads the opposition Civic Platform party, denounced the tabling of the bill as an \"announcement of a coup\", the AFP news agency reports. Earlier this week, the Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner, Nils Muiznieks, said the reforms were \"a major setback for judicial independence\". Meanwhile, Manfred Weber, the leader of the European Parliament's largest grouping, the EPP, said \"Law and Justice is putting an end to the rule of law and leaving the European community of values\".", "question": "Poland 's parliament has approved a bill to give MPs and the justice minister the power to appoint judges without consulting judicial @placeholder .", "option_0": "activities", "option_1": "sources", "option_2": "controls", "option_3": "levels", "option_4": "circles", "label": 4}

{"article": "Since April, convicted criminals in England and Wales have had to pay a charge of between £150 and £1,200 towards the cost of their case. MPs on the justice select committee said the charge, which is not means-tested, created \"serious problems\" and was often \"grossly disproportionate\". Ministers said it was under review. The fee is paid on top of fines, compensation orders and defendants' own legal charges, and is higher for those convicted after pleading not guilty. It is set according to the type of case, with the minimum charge for magistrates' courts and the maximum level for crown court cases. In March, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the fee would ensure that criminals \"pay their way\". But chairman of the cross-party committee Bob Neill said: \"The evidence we have received has prompted grave misgivings about the operation of the charge, and whether, as currently framed, it is compatible with the principles of justice.\" He added that \"in many cases it is grossly disproportionate\" and created \"perverse incentives - not only for defendants to plead guilty but for sentencers to reduce awards of compensation and prosecution costs\". The committee's report said the lack of discretion for judges and magistrates on the level of the charge was creating \"unacceptable consequences within the criminal justice system\". It cited the case of a woman who had admitted stealing a four-pack of Mars Bars worth 75p, saying she \"had not eaten in days\" after her benefits were sanctioned. She was ordered to pay a £150 criminal courts charge on top of her £73 fine, £85 costs, a £20 victim surcharge and 75p compensation. The committee also said it was \"highly sceptical\" of government claims that the charges could deliver a net revenue of £80m to £160m a year by 2023 - with an annual cost of collection of about £20m and a £5m bill for imprisoning defaulters. The Ministry of Justice said the concerns were noted and the operation of the fee was being kept under review. It comes after Justice Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament earlier this month that the charge was generating revenue and helping to \"ensure that the taxpayer is not the first port of call for supporting the way in which our courts operate\". But Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the criminal courts charge was \"unrealistic and unjust\" and called on the Ministry of Justice to \"suspend this policy immediately\". \"The innocent have been put under pressure to plead guilty, and ordering indigent people to pay money they simply do not have is never going to work,\" she said.", "question": "The criminal courts charge should be @placeholder by ministers , a parliamentary committee has said , as it raised \" grave misgivings \" about the fee 's benefits .", "option_0": "held", "option_1": "approved", "option_2": "reviewed", "option_3": "scrapped", "option_4": "investigated", "label": 3}
{"article": "But a quick glimpse at any high street with its rows of closed-down signs, pound shops and charity outlets suggest that consumers don't entirely agree. Now a new phenomenon - dubbed social shopping - threatens to incorporate the missing social element in online shopping and possibly destroy even more bricks and mortar stores. Social shopping encompasses a range of ideas, from shopping within social networks, to shopping-specific search engines that use friends recommendations to group buying sites such as Groupon. Groupon harnesses the power of the crowd to bring people daily deals that they may not even have known they wanted - from manicures to mountain biking. It has a very simple business model - people sign up for offers and once the required number of people are registered, the deal is confirmed and a voucher is sent to your inbox. The firm has five million users in the UK alone, and is said to be the fastest growing company ever. It puts much of its growth down to web-based recommendations - people see a deal and spread it among their online friends but not everyone is convinced by its social credentials. \"There are a lot of myths about how social Groupon is. In the beginning many deals may have been spread via social networks but now it is primarily through a daily e-+mail,\" said Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru, who has recently authored a report on social shopping. Word-of-mouth may have helped catapult Groupon into the limelight but its quarter of a billion dollar marketing spend probably played an even bigger role, thinks Ms Mulpuru. As the world's largest social network Facebook is keen that people talk to retailers as well as their friends and it is trying to figure out how to make the most out of social shopping. It boasts that half of the top 25 retailers use the site but the level of integration varies, from those who simply see it as a way to gain fans to \"like\" their brands to firms, such as clothing firm Asos, which are happy to allow users to make purchases from within the social network. Asos is one of Facebook's biggest successes. It puts its full catalogue on the site and its fan page has 800,000 members. Amazon uses the social network to offer product suggestions based on likes and favourites pulled from users' profile information. It has also introduced gift recommendations which let you know which of your friends have upcoming birthdays and suggests presents for them based on what they have shared with Amazon. Ticketing firm TicketMaster offers anyone who has bought a ticket on its site the chance to share the purchase information with their Facebook friends. It claims to have increased its revenue as a result of this feature. Meanwhile Levi's has what Facebook describes as a \"social store front\", offering users jeans that their friends may have liked and even using information to influence its supply chain. So if people in London are \"liking\" the skinny jeans most and people in Manchester are \"liking\" the bootcut style they can simply adjust their stock to match this. And herein, for Ms Mulpuru, lies the real power of social shopping - as a tool for retailers. \"There is a ton of data that people share about themselves that the retailer can use to make more relevant offers. It is far more a personalisation tactic than about getting or retaining customers,\" she said. Facebook's director of business development Christian Hernandez believes that Facebook can help users \"connect to brands that they care about\" and he reckons that among his Facebook friends there is plenty of chatter about shopping. But Ms Mulpuru is not convinced it will become a shopping hub any time soon. \"TV didn't transform retail and neither will Facebook. At the end of the day no-one buys something as the result of a link. The truth is that large brands just have not experienced any sizable gains in direct sales from Facebook,\" she said. \"In spite of hundreds of thousands of developers having been given the opportunity to create useful shopping applications or to integrate commerce into Facebook, there has yet to be a blockbuster success,\" she added. It hasn't stopped a raft of companies betting that social and shopping is a powerful combination. Three former Yahoo executives have set up a dedicated social network aimed entirely at shoppers. Dubbed ChoozOn , the start-up is built entirely around shopping and personalised deals. It allows users to manage their various deals and discount services and upcoming apps for the iPhone and Android handsets will highlight nearby deals. Users can sign up for loyalty programmes and if they share their shopping preferences and the brands and retailers they like best, the shops will fashion specific discounts for them. Meanwhile UK start-up Shopow (Shopper Power) offers a shopping search engine that aggregates thousands of retailers and products across all areas of consumer goods. Like other price comparison sites it allow users to compare goods by criteria such as price, retailer, service and delivery, but it also integrates various social functions. It will display reviews and deals that have already been collected around a product, as well as drawing in more personal views. \"Shopow is somewhere where you can interact with friends but also rate your recent purchases,\" explained co-founder Kevin Flood. He thinks people are far more likely offer to useful feedback via such a site than on Facebook. \"While some deals are appropriate to share on Facebook, you wouldn't share your experiences with a dishwasher on there,\" he said. The ability of retailers to engage directly with consumers is a very powerful one and some have taken bold steps in this direction. In February, US fashion designer Derek Lam harnessed the power of the web when he asked eBayers to vote on which of 16 dresses should form his summer collection. More than 120,000 people voted and the five winners went on sale in May. Not wanting to be left out, the high street too is embracing social media. In March, London's largest shopping centre Westfield unveiled a tweet mirror that allowed shoppers to try on an outfit and share the image in real time with friends and followers on Twitter. The mirror, brainchild of Dutch firm Nedap Retail, is already installed in dozens of shops in Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland.

Russian forces annexed Crimea in March 2014, during Ukraine's crisis. Public transport is still running and Crimean hospitals are using generators. A state of emergency was imposed in Crimea on Sunday after two more key pylons were damaged - bringing the total to four. Monday was declared a non-working day. It is still not clear how exactly the pylons were damaged in Kherson, a Ukrainian region adjacent to Crimea. That region has been tense since Russia's annexation of Crimea - an act that was condemned internationally. Crimean Tatar activists, denying repair workers access to the damaged power lines, suggested that the weakened pylons were blown down by the wind. But Ukraine's state energy company, Ukrenergo, said the damage was caused by \"shelling or the use of explosive devices\". Russia has blamed Ukrainian nationalists from far-right party Right Sector as well as Crimean Tatar activists, calling it \"an act of terrorism\". Earlier this year those activist groups prevented food lorries crossing into Crimea. The blackout has knocked out street lighting and cut cable and mobile internet. It has also forced the closure of some 150 schools. A Crimean Tatar activist told Ukraine's TV news broadcaster 112 Ukrayina that Russia must release \"political prisoners\" and let their leader Mustafa Dzhemilev return to Crimea in exchange for repairs to the power lines. But later Mr Dzhemilev, leader of the Crimean Tatar National Movement, told BBC Ukrainian that his supporters would grant repair workers access to the power lines. \"I think that Crimea will have electricity soon\", he said. Crimean Tatar activists accuse Russia of abusing Tatar rights and denying them a voice since a pro-Moscow government was installed in Crimea. Images on social media show Ukrainian flags on some damaged pylons - and Crimean Tatar flags on others. Crimean authorities said they had managed to partially reconnect the cities of Simferopol, Yalta and Sevastopol using generators. Only 30% of Crimea's electricity is generated locally - the rest comes from Ukraine, Russia's government daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta reported. Emergency power-saving measures have been imposed: Sevastopol is getting three hours' supply, followed by a six-hour cut; in Simferopol residents have three-hour power cuts three times a day. Ukrainian authorities said they encountered activists blockading the site when they tried to repair the damaged pylons. The power cut is threatening food outlets which rely on cold storage and lack generating capacity.

{"article": "Sections of London Bridge station's roof have been given to Vale of Rheidol Railway which operates small steam trains for tourists in mid Wales. London Bridge station, which opened in 1836 and is used by 55 million people, is undergoing a £6bn redevelopment. Network Rail has saved 16 columns, 14 beams and other elements of the roof. These parts of the Grade II-listed structure will form the cornerstone of the planned new locomotive museum in Aberystwyth. Robert Gambrill from the Vale of Rheidol Railway said it would be used to display a unique collection of narrow gauge artefacts. \"The roof offers an opportunity to show the locomotives in context within a train-shed environment and the Vale of Rheidol will work hard to recreate the atmosphere, which only a London terminus can provide,\" he said. \"Years ago they sold London Bridge to Arizona and now they've given London Bridge station to Aberystwyth.\" Mr Gambrill said it had taken a year to arrange a deal to remove about a third of London Bridge station's old barrel arch roof. All of the beams and columns had to be removed by cranes at night and at weekends, with specialist equipment needed to excavate the columns from their base plates after 150 years. The railway was built in 1901, opening to passengers on 22 December 1902. The 12-mile (20km) service started at the harbour in Aberystwyth and continued to Devil's Bridge. It was built originally to carry lead ore from the mines in the valley. In 1923 it became the property of the Great Western Railway and it was absorbed into British Railways on 1 January 1948. The 1960s signalled an era of neglect and the station moved to the vacant bay platform at Aberystwyth's main station. Having survived the Beeching cuts the line soldiered on until 1988 when it was to be sold. It was bought by the Phyllis Rampton Narrow Gauge Railway Trust in 1991. The line attracts around 40,000 visitors annually from all over the world. Mr Gambrill said there had been doubts initially whether enough of the beams and columns could be saved to enable the museum to be built. \"It has been a pleasure to work with such a dedicated team from Network Rail - their care and attention to detail has ensured as much of the structure that we need has been saved,\" he said. \"Without their co-operation none of this would have been possible. We all look forward to unlocking the potential of our collection and seeing the Vale of Rheidol becoming a world class tourist attraction for Wales.\" Chris Drabble of Network Rail said the teams who worked on the project could be proud of what they had achieved. \"This great news has been possible because many people, from many organisations have been working together,\" he added. \"Up until the actual structures were lifted, we were never sure if any of this would be technically possible, so all of the teams can be really proud of what they have achieved.\" The Vale of Rheidol intends to submit plans for a 100,000 sq ft (9,300 sq m) museum to Ceredigion council and also plans to apply for grants to fund the project. The railway said it had a \"unique historic collection\" of around 30 locomotives and rolling stock, much of which was built in the UK and had never been displayed in public.", "question": "Part of London 's oldest train station is set to be @placeholder in Aberystwyth as part of a £ 10 m plan for a narrow gauge railway museum .", "option_0": "scrapped", "option_1": "rebuilt", "option_2": "included", "option_3": "preserved", "option_4": "lost", "label": 1}

{"article": "It's fair to say that this figure relies on relevant, rigorous and detailed economic modelling on what would happen to national income if the UK left the EU, based on what the alternatives would be. But ultimately that's a hard task given that no economy of the UK's size has ever left the EU before, so there must be uncertainty about the future. Indeed, economic modelling can be a perilous business. This particular figure is underpinned by the assumption that the UK would negotiate a Canada-style trade deal in place of EU membership. The Treasury's analysis is that this would mean slower growth compared to remaining in the EU - and that would mean less tax coming into the Treasury. Brexiteers, of course, argue that the UK would secure its own unique and superior trade deal and that the analysis ignores potential trade deals that the UK outside of the EU might strike with China or India. And it's important to note that this estimate is for the impact in 2030, not an immediate effect. £36bn, as the Treasury document says, would be \"equivalent\" to raising the basic rate of income tax by around 8p from 20p to 28p. Alternatively any government could cut spending instead, increase other taxes or choose to borrow more money.

{"article": "\"It is just nice to feel like a mum, rather than just somebody watching,\" Anna Cox tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme, as she takes the temperature of her baby. Lola was born at just 23 weeks. She had a twin brother who sadly did not survive and she was given little hope of survival. \"During labour, one of the neo-natal consultants came to see us and painted a really bad picture that she could have all sorts of problems,\" Anna says. Lola was cared for at St James's University Hospital in Leeds -the first in the UK to implement a family integrated care system. It put parents - not nurses - in charge of everything other than the most complicated medical treatments for their premature babies while they were in hospital. \"One of the jobs we have to do is take her temperature, maybe every three or four hours,\" Anna says. \"It is a pretty simple procedure really.\" However, parents also perform more complicated tasks, including inserting a tube into their baby's nose to allow them to feed. \"There are certain things they [nurses] obviously watch over you quite a bit to begin with because it needs to be done right,\" she says. \"They do like to make sure you know what you're doing, they wouldn't just leave you to it.\" Katie Crossley's daughter, Molly, was born eight weeks early and had breathing difficulties. \"While I'm here, I pretty much do everything that a normal mum would do,\" she says. \"Everything, from feeding to medicine, cleaning, bathing.\" She has also been taught how to insert a tube up Molly's nose and into her stomach allowing her to be fed. \"Being around it and watching it has made me more confident when I've come to actually doing it,\" she says. In the past, caring for premature babies usually meant keeping parents at arm's length. As recently as 20 years ago, the closest parents of premature babies could get to their newborns was looking at them through a glass window. It meant the bond between parent and child was harder to establish and breastfeeding rates were often lower. But the idea of putting parents in charge of neonatal care is not a new one. In the 1970s in Tallinn, Estonia - then part of the Soviet Union - the head of the local hospital faced a problem. The hospital had too many premature babies to look after and not enough nurses. However, they soon noticed the system was helping babies. Under his system, mothers had more regular \"skin to skin\" contact with premature babies. It resulted in better breastfeeding rates and shorter hospital stays. It took 30 years for other hospitals to copy the system, but now the system has been introduced in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and now Leeds. Dr Liz McKechnie, consultant neonatologist at St James's, says the family integrated care scheme aims to put the parent at \"the very centre of the team caring for the baby\". \"It is not rocket science, it is such a straightforward thing to do, to allow parents to look after their babies,\" she says. She is adamant the move was not down to cost-cutting and that nursing levels on the unit have not dropped. \"In the past, care has been very much the nurse leading it, so they're saying 'right, it's feed time, it's bath time'. Whereas now, it is very much the parents who are leading that. \"They are feeding the baby when the baby needs feeding, rather than when the clock says it is feed time - and that's much better for the baby.\" She says the new system was a \"major cultural change\" and caused anxiety among nurses on the neonatal unit when it was introduced 18 months ago. Nurses on the ward say training parents to care for their babies takes as long - if not longer - than doing the procedures themselves. But they say families are getting home sooner, the long-term development of babies is improving and breastfeeding rates have increased. The system is about to be trialled in the intensive care unit in St James's sister hospital. As for Lola, she was allowed home just before she was 14 weeks old. \"Without the family integrated care we would've been in a lot longer,\" says her mother, Anna. \"Lola is still on oxygen and [otherwise] they wouldn't have allowed us to come home with that. \"I feel really confident in everything they taught us.\" Dr McKechnie adds: \"The fact is that families are going home more confident and more able to care for their babies, and that means a lot. \"Nobody wants to stop it, it is definitely here to stay, everybody can see the benefits of it.\" Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.", "question": "On a hospital ward in Leeds , parents of premature babies are @placeholder to help care for their newborns - from taking temperatures to the delicate task of inserting feeding tubes .

{"article": "I've been living in South Africa since 1997, my wife is South African and we have two children, aged 14 and 16. My wife is worried about what future our children will have if the xenophobic attacks become the norm. We don't know how to explain the hatred against Nigerians to our families, to our children. This is the third round of attacks against foreigners; one was in 2008 where people were killed, again in 2015. I now get calls from home, my family members want to know if we're safe, they see the stories in the news. I do feel safe, I feel safe because I live in the suburbs away from where the unrest and violence has been happening but I don't know if I could say that if I was living in a poorer area. There are parts of this city that are no-man's land, where the police have no control over what happens, where there are no consequences for wrong-doing, that is unfortunately where the xenophobia has thrived. There is just lawlessness from all sides, by all nationalities and that sort of environment is a ticking time-bomb. Life is different in the suburbs but I do worry about my fellow Africans who become victims in these incidents, while they have nothing to do with crime. I love this country, I consider it my home and it breaks my heart to see what is happening. The government needs to seriously address the concerns people are raising - both South Africans and foreigners. People here are saying that Nigerians are bringing drugs and prostitution but can I tell you something, while I don't condone crime, Nigerians are not the only ones involved in crime here. It's all too easy to profile one group and that is not right, it's also dangerous and puts people's lives in danger. It's important for South Africans to know that not all of us are criminals, the same way not all South Africans are engaged in crime. They need to understand that you cannot paint people with one brush. I am a hard-working man and there are many law-abiding foreigners who are helping to building the country. I own a restaurant in Randburg, we make Nigerian food and South African dishes. I also own a liquor store which has been in business since 2007. All I want to do is provide for my family and help people make a living too - some of my employees are South African. It has been a long road to get to this point. Leaving your home with nothing is not easy. There was a time when I had nothing: No money, no food, no-one. I didn't have a place to sleep and would sleep in police stations and in the streets. I moved here to study but when I came into the country, life was more difficult than I imagined it would be. It was not easy for me to register because of financial constraints but I stayed because South Africa is one of the best countries in Africa - in terms of facilities. There are better opportunities. Everyone wants a better life for themselves and their family and South Africa is seen as the best place for that but it's not easy. After years of working part-time jobs I raised enough to finally take myself to school, I completed a business management course in 2010 and that has helped me with running my businesses. South Africa is my home now, everything I own is here -  that's why I am also unhappy about the crime and the high unemployment here. These things make life difficult. I understand where the anger is coming from - obviously if you are poor and see your neighbour, who is not even from here, succeeding it will create tensions. Nigerians love being in the lime-light and have a basket-mouth [trash-talker] and are showy. When we have money, even if it's a little, we want people to know - this makes us more noticeable than other nationalities. I think the Nigerians living here need to be aware of that and be sensitive to the issues that may cause. As for the crime, I know that sometimes people do bad things to earn a living but imagine if that was your own child that was addicted to drugs or being used as a prostitute. I'm a parent and I worry about that, that's why I don't support crime at all. Other nationalities need to respect the laws of the country, we are visitors here and need to remember that.

He said changes in the UK to digital registration could be mirrored in Guernsey.

Jones believes \"100%\" that rugby union players can learn from the 13-a-side game - and a more permanent role for former Australia Test half-back Johns is a possibility. \"Guys like Andrew Johns touched the ball 50 or 60 times in a game, had to fix defenders, knew when to drift and be straight, how to use your eyes, where to position your hands,\" Jones added. \"I've always admired his skills as a player, and we've been chatting for a while about the possibility of him coming in and doing a little bit of work.\" Only flanker James Haskell and winger Jack Nowell were unable to take part as England trained in Sydney. Haskell has a foot injury and is a major doubt to be fit for Saturday, but Jones says the Wasps forward has an \"amazing capacity to absorb pain\" and could yet be in contention. Winger Nowell is going through return-to-play protocols after concussion, with Jones set to name his 23-man squad on Thursday. \"In terms of selection we always pick our best 23, and we will be doing that.

{"article": "Dom Heaume put the hosts ahead inside three minutes before Ross Allen brilliantly smashed in the second to double the advantage. Ben Gallichan twice hit the post for Jersey but despite having the bulk of possession they were not clinical enough in attack. Karl Hinds pulled one back from close range but Guernsey held on for the win. The result means the Greens have now won the title 46 times, Jersey 53, with one shared in 1937 and Alderney lifting the Vase once, in 1920. Guernsey were quickest out of the blocks and went in front when Dave Rihoy's shot was palmed away by Jersey goalkeeper Euan van der Vliet, but Heaume was there to calmly volley in the rebound and give his side the best possible start. At the other end Gallichan's angled header came back off the far post, before Allen's superb strike across van der Vliet from a tight angle flew in and put Guernsey firmly in control midway through the half. Allen had latched onto a quickly taken Rihoy throw, catching the Jersey defence off guard, and has now netted in six different Muratti finals stretching back to 2010. Gallichan fired against the post again after half an hour, when he should have hit the target but instead dragged his close-range shot onto the upright. As the game wore on it was Jersey who dominated possession, with the Sarnians seemingly happy to drop deep and let their opponents have the ball in the middle third. Striker Craig Russell, a surprise absentee from Martin Cassidy's starting line-up, was introduced from the bench on the hour mark as the visitors continued to have more of the possession. It was fellow substitute Hinds who finally found a way past Leroi Riley, when the ball dropped to him in the box and his prodded effort found the corner of the net with quarter of an hour still to go. The Reds went close through Jack Cannon's free-kick before the last golden chance for an equaliser fell to captain Cav Miley, but his strike from just inside the box went over the bar and Guernsey could celebrate only their second home Muratti triumph since 2001.", "question": "Guernsey got their @placeholder back on the Murrati Vase with a hard - fought 2 - 1 win over rivals Jersey at Footes Lane .", "option_0": "game", "option_1": "centre", "option_2": "focus", "option_3": "hands", "option_4": "chances", "label": 3}
{"article": "This possibility, described in a new computer modelling study, could explain why rocks from Earth and the Moon are much more alike than we would expect from this \"giant impact hypothesis\". The research forms one of three papers published in the journal Nature. Two others report subtle, previously unseen differences in lunar rocks. Scientists say the new findings paint a consistent - and much clearer - picture of our satellite's history. The modelling study, done by researchers from Israel and France, precisely simulated the turmoil of the early, inner Solar System and quantifies the variety of collisions that might have occurred. In its early stages, the proto-Earth would have been subjected to a string of brutal collisions with other wannabe planets. According to our best understanding, the last of these was a cataclysmic tangle with a planetary body just ten times lighter than Earth - and the resulting debris eventually clumped together to make the Moon. The problem is that most of what became the Moon should have come from the imposter - and based on our existing knowledge of what was flying where at that time, that imposter was thought to be a very different type of planet. \"So if the impactor had a different composition from the Earth, we should expect the Moon to have a different composition,\" Dr Hagai Perets, one of the study's authors, told the Nature podcast. But this is not the case. \"They are almost identical. This is one of the major challenges for this really beautiful giant impact hypothesis,\" said Dr Perets, from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. This is why a study made headlines in 2014 when it pinpointed some tiny differences between Earth and Moon rocks. What Dr Perets and his colleagues found in their new simulations was that the impactor planet might, in fact, have been made of surprisingly similar stuff to the Earth - leaving only the sort of subtle differences that we do see in lunar material. \"What we found is that many of these impactors on a planet have very similar composition to that of the planets they impact - as similar as what we measure between the Earth and the Moon,\" Dr Perets explained. Specifically, the models indicated a 20% chance that the impact could have been between such similar proto-planets. These odds give our prevailing \"origins story\" for the Moon a fighting chance, Dr Perets said. \"[Now] I am even more confident about the giant impact hypothesis.\" A different challenge to our current ideas about the Moon relates to what happened subsequently. To explain certain details in the Earth's make-up, scientists have proposed that both the Earth and Moon amassed a large amount of extra matter - a so-called \"late veneer\" - during a subsequent period when they were bombarded by huge numbers of meteorites. And just like the original giant impact, this process should also have left a trail of evidence that had not been detected until now. Even if, as the French-Israeli study now suggests, the Earth and Moon got started from very similar building blocks, this bombardment should have had a much bigger effect on the bulkier, heavier Earth with its much stronger gravity, shifting the balance of its ingredients away from that of the Moon. The two new investigations of lunar rocks, one from the US and one from Germany, find support for that shift for the first time, by analysing samples from the Apollo missions with new levels of precision. Both teams looked specifically at traces of tungsten within small chunks of the Moon that they borrowed from Nasa, and found a small but tell-tale difference compared to Earth rock. The ratio of the metal's different isotopes was altered. Importantly, the ratios measured by the two teams match - and the difference fits what might be expected if the Earth collected a bigger \"veneer\" from the bombardment. \"The small, but significant, difference in the tungsten isotopic composition between Earth and the Moon perfectly corresponds to the different amounts of material gathered by Earth and the moon post-impact,\" said Prof Richard Walker from the University of Maryland, one of the authors on the US study. Considering the three studies in total, Dr Matthias Willbold from the University of Manchester told the BBC he was impressed and excited. \"They all tell the same story - it all falls into place,\" said Dr Willbold, a planetary scientist who has also investigated the late veneer idea using tungsten ratios. \"It's quite striking. [The lunar rock studies] mention that it is quite baffling that the Earth and Moon have the same starting composition, before the bombardment. \"And that links perfectly into the modelling paper, where they say look - we can resolve that. If you look at the models, the impactor and the Earth were similar, so we just solved your problem!\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter", "question": "The Moon may have been formed by a collision between Earth and an @placeholder that was strikingly similar in composition to our own planet .", "option_0": "object", "option_1": "exhibition", "option_2": "earth", "option_3": "orbit", "option_4": "folk", "label": 0}
{"article": "Now imagine the same landlord throws in a bowl of chips for free - because you are a regular at the pub three nights a week. Then the pub closes for a couple of weeks for refurbishment. So, you go to another pub - The Red Lion - a few hundred yards further down the road. A little surprisingly, the landlord at that pub knows your favourite pint too, even though you have never been in before. You find out that the Dog and Duck landlord has sold on information about your tastes to the landlord at The Red Lion. How do you feel? A bit concerned, perhaps. But worse is to come. You subsequently find out that - knowing what you are going to order - the landlord at The Red Lion has charged you 10p more than he has charged another customer. You don't even get a free bowl of chips! This might seem like a very far-fetched example. However, shift this whole buying process online - and it sums up a big issue for internet shoppers. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) wants to know more about personalised pricing. This occurs if a retailer offers different prices depending on information they have collected about that customer. This is done primarily in two ways. Firstly, retailers can collect details of a customer's previous purchases made on the website. Secondly, they can buy information about the customer's purchases or internet searches from a third party. The OFT wants to know if consumers are aware that all this data is being collected about their shopping and searching preferences, as well as if this puts consumers off buying on the internet. The regulator says that there is no evidence, but a lot of concern, that this information allows retailers to charge a higher price to certain customers - just like the hypothetical landlord at The Red Lion. \"It is important we understand what control shoppers have over their profile and whether firms are using shoppers' profiles to charge different prices for goods or services,\" says Clive Maxwell, chief executive of the OFT. Concerns have been raised about flights or hotel rates. It is alleged that in some cases, when a potential customer has looked once, then taken a few minutes to compare the cost elsewhere, they return to find the price may have risen. However, there has been no firm proof of this. Other suggestions have included different prices for people using different brands of computers, or living in different areas, as they give an indication of their wealth. Of course, such a scenario could work in a consumer's favour. A regular customer, or one the retailer would like to keep, may be offered a discount, just like the free bowl of chips in our earlier example. \"This is the transfer online of something that has been happening offline for a very long time,\" says Vanessa Barnett, partner and online marketing expert at law firm Charles Russell. The essential difference, she says, is that receiving a discount in person is much more obvious than when it is done online. She adds that consumers always have the power to withdraw their custom from the scurrilous retailer, online or offline. Technology commentator Tom Cheesewright agrees. Consumers do not like being unfairly treated because of what online retailers know about them, but they do like the discounts and better treatment that might come from the same information. So, where does this information come from anyway? Clearly, retailers can track the purchases a customer makes at their online store. In addition, websites can record information in text files called cookies. Cookies are widely used to record what repeat visitors view on a site and by advertisers to track users online. They are also used to recognise customers, make suggestions, or store their details to make the process quicker. There has been particular concern about tracking cookies, used by advertisers, which keep tabs on the various websites that you browse, so they can target you with \"relevant\" advertisements. Official statistics show that online sales were 11% higher in October than the same month a year earlier. So, this information can be very valuable indeed. Concerns about cookies have already prompted action under European law which came into force on 26 May. It requires websites to explain what cookies are and to get users' permission before using them. So, a permission request will be popping up relatively regularly at the moment for internet users. In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) recently said that it would launch a crackdown on those not complying, although there are suggestions that many websites are failing to do so. They could face fines of up to Â£500,000 each. In the US, regulators are urging internet companies to have a \"do not track\" system in place that gives consumers more control over their personal data online. In a separate development in the UK, the Department for Business has a \"midata\" programme, which encourages various banks and energy companies to release data about a customer's consumption if it is requested. Unlike online tracking, this simply keeps a note of their consumption habits of, for example, their gas and electricity. In these fields, it may allow people access to details that would help them get the most appropriate tariff. It remains to be seen whether the government will eventually legislate to encourage supermarkets to release similar data. This data is gathered on loyalty cards, which hold information about families' eating habits, when they shop, and how much they spend. At this point, the gap between data gathered by an online shopper and somebody who visits a store narrows significantly. As a result, such trends have attracted the attention of the government and the regulator. The OFT, which is working with international counterparts during its enquiries, will report in spring 2013 on whether an investigation is needed into personalised pricing. In the meantime, customers will have to rely on internet retailers acting like the landlord at the Dog and Duck.", "question": "Imagine going into your local pub - the Dog and Duck - and being greeted by the landlord who already knows your favourite tipple and starts to @placeholder it before you even reach the bar .", "option_0": "investigate", "option_1": "write", "option_2": "arrive", "option_3": "pour", "option_4": "smash", "label": 3}

{"article": "US researchers say the slow-is-more-accurate rule generally applies. In a series of calculations, they looked at the physics behind releasing a projectile with the human arm. Their equations suggest a slow underarm throw is the best strategy for getting a piece of paper into a nearby bin. Lead researcher Madhusudhan Venkadesan, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Yale University, said faster throws tend to be less accurate. This is because the ball travels in a nearly straight line, so any errors in the angle at which the object is released tend to be amplified. In slow and curved flight paths, small errors in the angle of release have little effect, he said. \"What we find is that almost the slowest arc is often the most accurate,\" said Dr Venkadesan. \"We've compared these calculations to published data of people throwing into wastebaskets; we've compared it to a study in dart throwing.\" In sports such as basketball or darts, the strategy depends on conditions and the trade-off needed between speed and accuracy. For example, experienced darts players throw overarm at about 5.5 metres per second, optimally releasing the dart 17 to 37 degrees before the arm becomes vertical. On the cricket pitch, fielders are more likely to strike the wicket with a fast underarm throw. And in basketball, the underhand free throw, nicknamed \"the granny throw\", has a marginal advantage over overhand, despite almost disappearing from the game. Accurate throwing is uniquely human - a skill relied upon by our ancient ancestors for hunting with spears or stone tools.

Warmly welcomed by David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, who said it confirmed that his party was en route for second place and an opportunity, as he put it, to close the sore of independence. 02:30 - Another result. Another very poor result for Labour. For the Tories, this could be insubstantial in wider terms but that is a decent increase in the vote in Hamilton. More to come, much more, but it seems that the rethink in Labour ranks will have to be deep and searching. No political party has a right to exist, let alone to command support. Labour - again, to stress, on results so far - may be facing a fundamental reappraisal. 01:04 - Congratulations to the first MSPs in Orkney and Rutherglen.

{"article": "Conversations with Arab and Western sources make it clear there is a major unifying goal in these new discussions: to avoid the collapse of Syria's security forces and its civilian institutions. That means all sides are now moving away from rigid positions taken when Syria's uprising erupted more than four years ago. \"[President Bashar al-] Assad leaving before the process starts doesn't make sense any more,\" a senior Arab diplomat in the region told me. \"If he leaves suddenly, two-thirds of his commanders would go with him and Syria would collapse.\" The steady rise of the so-called Islamic State, and mounting pressures on a stretched Syrian army has rung alarm bells over the threat of an ungoverned Syria falling into the hands of extremists. The risk posed by another fractured Middle East country is now too big to ignore. So is this summer's tragic exodus of hundreds of thousands of Syrians desperate to reach Europe. Then, the startling September surprise of Russia's air sorties into Syria set the stage for the most determined diplomacy of Syria's crisis. Ideas emerging from Arab and Western capitals include a ceasefire, an amnesty for forces on both sides, and a transitional government intended to ensure an orderly process that would lead to the drafting of a new constitution and elections. There's talk of a transition that could last up to two years. Some of these ideas are also appearing in reports about proposals coming from Russia and Iran.  Iran has had its own \"four-point plan\" for a few years, which was studied with interest by the UN. But it stayed on the shelf while Iran was kept out of talks. Integrating an array of armed forces will be fraught with difficulties, if not dangers, but there is a hope that the reform of civilian structures is within easier reach. Sources speak of discussions concerning which senior members of President Assad's team would be asked to leave - a figure of 10 -15 people was cited. There's also a hope that new, more credible, leaders will emerge from the opposition during this period to replace figures seen as lacking support inside Syria. \"They're nice people but they have no base,\" is how one source backing the opposition put it. Having convincing alternatives to take charge is seen as crucial to reassure Russia and Iran, who back President Assad. I'm told that names of possible candidates are already being drawn up and shared. An official involved in recent talks with Russia quoted the Russians in this way: \"Where is the opposition? If you can assure us it will work we are not wedded to Assad.\" Iran and Russia recently stepped up their military support to bolster President Assad's embattled position on many key fronts. But in private, officials have said for some time that their objective is to \"save Syria, not Assad.\" The biggest gap, however, is still over how long President Assad can remain part of the process. His opponents insist this process cannot start with him unless it is absolutely clear it will end without him. This week's press conference in Riyadh, which saw Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and the visiting British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond calling for a fixed departure provoked a sharp rebuke from Damascus. Syrian Information Minister Umran al-Zu'bi condemned those with \"blood on their hands\" who were \"speaking about the internal affairs of a country that has always been and will remain free and owns its decisions.\" In the end, it is Syrians themselves who will have to make the tough choices.  Members of the Free Syrian Army, seen as moderate forces, have been visiting Moscow in a sign that there may be room for discussion. But powerful groups linked to al-Qaeda, as well as Islamic State fighters, want nothing to do with this negotiated process. They're on terrorist black lists so they aren't invited anyway, but there is still a long hard campaign ahead to try to dislodge them. And there is still deep scepticism that gaps in the negotiating process can be closed, and still deep-seated suspicion and animosity between arch rivals Iran and Saud Arabia, along with some other Gulf states. Saudi King Salman received telephone calls from President Vladimir Putin and President Barack Obama in the past week, and visits from US Secretary of State John Kerry and Philip Hammond. The Saudi monarch is understood to have given his blessing to Iran's inclusion in the process. Foreign Minister Al-Jubeir told me: \"I wouldn't call it a place at the negotiating table, it's about being part of the conversation.\" And if this fails, there is clearly a Plan B on all sides, for an accelerated military option. Military supplies are already being stepped up even as talks proceed. \"It's not going to be easy and the longer it takes, the more complicated it gets,\" is how a senior Arab diplomat in the region put it. \"That's why an orderly process is better than a military one where institutions collapse.\"", "question": "The most concerted diplomatic push so far to end Syria 's punishing war has concentrated @placeholder on all sides of a bitter divide .", "option_0": "it", "option_1": "minds", "option_2": "syria", "option_3": "impact", "option_4": "forces", "label": 1}
{"article": "English Heritage (EH) is calling on members of the public to assess Grade II listed buildings in their area and flag up if they think they are falling into disrepair. There are 345,000 Grade II listed buildings in England and the body has extended its Heritage at Risk Register to include these types of sites for the first time. The list already covers Grade II buildings in London and Grade I and Grade II* buildings in the rest of England but the list is expected to increase as Grade II buildings account for 92% of all those listed. Buildings already identified as \"at risk\" include the oldest house in Nottingham, a women only lido in Reading and a bomb store in Suffolk. EH was at the nuclear bomb facility at Barnham to launch the scheme. John Ette, inspector of monuments for English Heritage, said: \"We've always targeted Grade I, Grade II* and scheduled monuments, but this year we're targeting Grade II listed buildings via a series of pilot studies to extend what we're learnt. \"We're working with local authorities, building preservation trusts or owners to look at what we can do with the Grade II ones, so we'll try to do up to 15 pilot studies to see what we can learn.\" Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said: \"Grade II buildings are the bulk of the nation's heritage treasury. \"When one of them is lost, it's as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past - something that made your street or your village special will have gone.\" To begin the project, EH has earmarked £250,000 to run the pilot surveys. Edward Impey, director of heritage protection for English Heritage, said they would choose a diverse range of areas including urban, rural and those with higher economic challenges for the scheme which will run for a year. EH staff have been redeployed in new Heritage at Risk teams in each of EH's nine local offices to work exclusively on supporting owners, developers, local authorities and volunteers in rescuing buildings so they can be removed from the list. Mr Impey said: \"The point of the list is to catch things early - some Grade II buildings don't exist any more. \"We don't know how many buildings are at risk but our ambition is to assess them all and look at how many are deemed to be at risk. \"The first thing we need to know is their condition on a case-by-case basis.\" EH will publish an assessment guide online so people can review a building from the outside and gauge if it is at risk. He said: \"We'll ask them things like: 'Is it occupied, has it got broken windows and plants growing out of the gutters?'.\" Once a building is submitted it will be assessed by English Heritage who will work with funding bodies and local authorities and groups to try to put together a restoration programme. But EH will not be able to fund all of the work - the body has seen its own budget cuts from £30m in 1999 to £12.5m. And while in the past developers might repair a building knowing they could sell it and recoup their costs, the \"conservation deficit\" has  rocketed during the recession.

{"article": "The findings, presented at the Neuroscience 2016 conference, harnessed data from 2.4 million people who downloaded the game. Getting lost is one of the first symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. And the researchers at University College London believe the results could help make a dementia test. Sea Hero Quest is a nautical adventure to save an old sailor's lost memories. With the touch of a smartphone screen, players sail a boat round desert islands and icy oceans. The game anonymously records the player's sense of direction and navigational ability as they work their way through the levels. Some require them to weave through waterways and fire a flare back home, while others challenge them to memorise a sequence of buoys and then sail round them. Data harnessed from the flare levels is the first to have been analysed, by scientists at University College London. And it suggests the sense of direction declines consistently after the teenage years. Players aged 19 were 74% accurate at firing the flare back home, but accuracy fell year by year until it reached 46% at age 75. Dr Hugo Spiers told the BBC: \"What we're able to announce to the world is it does decline across the lifespan, the ability to shoot the flare back to the target - that sense of direction.\" The data also suggests men have a slight better sense of direction than women and that the Nordic nations outperform the rest in the world, although it is not yet clear why. Ideas include: The point of the research is to develop a way of diagnosing dementia in its earliest stages - something not yet possible. Becoming completely disorientated is normally rare, but is more common in people with Alzheimer's disease. Having a record of the normal decline in the internal compass could help doctors spot patients developing Alzheimer's. Dr Spiers added: \"The value of a future test built from Sea Hero Quest is that we will be able to provide a diagnostic for Alzheimer's dementia and a tool that allows us to monitor performance in drug trials.\" Hilary Evans, the chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Sadly, we hear all too frequently of people getting lost and being found miles away from home. \"Researchers believe that these problems with spatial navigation could form the basis of a diagnostic test for the early stages of diseases like Alzheimer's, which could add a valuable tool to a clinician's diagnostic armoury. \"For any new diagnostic tool to be effective, it must take into account natural variation in a particular skill or ability across the population.\" Using the game has provided scientists with unprecedented amounts of data from across the globe. The data collection from 2.4 million people passing some time in the evening or on the way to work would have taken 9,400 years in the lab. This project was funded by Deutsche Telekom and the game was designed by Glitchers. Michael Hornberger, a professor of applied dementia research at the University of East Anglia, said: \"The amount of data that has already been generated by people playing Sea Hero Quest all around the world is phenomenal and is enabling us to reveal a vital global benchmark of how people, of all ages and from all over the use spatial navigation.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "question": "The world 's largest dementia research experiment , which takes the form of a video game , has indicated the ability to @placeholder declines throughout life .", "option_0": "navigate", "option_1": "avoid", "option_2": "protect", "option_3": "attract", "option_4": "promote", "label": 0}

{"article": "Tour operators are bringing home UK tourists in Tunisia following a Foreign Office warning that another terror attack is \"highly likely\". Thousands of UK tourists booked to travel on summer package deals are being given an alternative or a refund. The financial impact for independent travellers could be more complex. So what does the change in Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice mean for your summer getaway? The FCO now advises against all but essential travel to Tunisia owing to the risk of a further terrorist attack after a gunman killed 38 holidaymakers, including 30 Britons, in the 26 June beach attack near Sousse. This has prompted tour operators to start bringing more than 3,000 holidaymakers back to the UK, and about 500 independent travellers have also been advised to return. Although this travel advice could be changed at any time, many tour operators have cancelled flights and holidays to Tunisia for the summer season. For the most part, those with package deals can go to another destination, or get their money back. Most of those who are travelling back early will get a refund for the holiday days lost. Customers should get in touch with their tour operator, travel agent or possibly their airline. Those travelling in the next 48 hours are being given priority. Travel association Abta suggests that anyone with bookings beyond the summer should wait until closer to their departure date before getting in touch. The biggest operators - such as Thomson - are allowing people to choose from any destinations \"currently on sale\". Clearly, the biggest operators will have more choice of destination. Holidaymakers should be given a decent choice, rather than a \"take it or leave it option\". In the rules of Abta-registered package deals is a right to an alternative holiday or a full refund - the customer can choose between the two. This is where things get a little more complicated. Airlines will generally reschedule flights, allowing people to travel at a different time or to a different destination. Cancellation fees may apply for accommodation or car hire. To get that money back, a claim on travel insurance may be needed. Some travel insurance policies, but not all, will cover the cost of cancellation. Many of those who only bought flights and are in Tunisia now are being helped by tour operators, but others should contact their airline. It is in the small print, but the insurer will be able to tell you. First of all, you would need to have bought the travel insurance before the advice from the FCO changed to advise against all but essential travel. Some insurers would have required policyholders to pay a bit more for travel disruption cover. Q&A for holidaymakers from Abta Foreign Office advice for travel to Tunisia No, no additional compensation is paid to package holiday customers. Thomson and First Choice are giving a Â£50 discount to some customers who take new flights to some alternative destinations. Those who are there are being strongly advised to return. Those who want to go should be looking at the FCO advice to find out when it might be safe again to travel.

It suggested First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would prefer David Cameron as prime minister over Ed Miliband. Mr Carmichael has denied he acted unlawfully. The petition was lodged at the court of session in Edinburgh last month to challenge the Orkney and Shetland constituency result. Papers lodged by Mr Carmichael's legal team said that he has \"not committed any illegal practice\", although he does accept \"mis-stating his awareness of the leaked memorandum\", which he originally claimed no knowledge of. His lawyers said this was \"an error of judgement on a political matter\" and \"it did not amount to a false statement of fact\". The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner has launched a formal inquiry into the conduct of Mr Carmichael. The watchdog will consider Mr Carmichael's actions under the MPs' code of conduct. The confidential memo at the centre of the controversy was written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office. It was a third-hand account of a conversation between Ms Sturgeon and the French ambassador, in which Ms Sturgeon was reported to have said she wanted David Cameron to remain as prime minister. Both the first minister and the ambassador insisted this was not the case, and the memo had contained a disclaimer that parts of the conversation may have been \"lost in translation\". Mr Carmichael had denied knowing about the memo when asked about the leak at the time, claiming the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist.

{"article": "Time, for too many of our fellow citizens, to choose between heating and eating. Labour's Jackie Baillie chose to divert our attention from the warm, contented glow surrounding Wenceslas - and to invite us to consider the poor guy outside gathering winter fuel. From Ms Baillie - standing in once more, pending Labour's leadership declaration on Saturday - this was a powerful, effective contribution. She began by inviting Nicola Sturgeon to disclose the direction of travel with regard to fuel poverty in Scotland - knowing full well, of course, that the results are not encouraging. From that point, Ms Baillie constructed a case of neglect by those responsible - including, she said, the Scottish government. In response, Ms Sturgeon was also in good form. Her tone was of persuasion, rather than tirade. Yes, the figures on fuel poverty were \"appalling\" - especially in an energy-rich country like Scotland. A clue in that added point to her position:  that Scotland currently lacked the full panoply of powers to tackle each element of fuel poverty. Notably, that Scotland lacked the powers to regulate the market and prices. Each accused the other of lacking ambition. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government's efforts on issues like energy efficiency were streets ahead of what was happening in England.  Insufficient, said Ms Baillie. In return, the first minister said that Labour's pledge to freeze fuel prices fell short: a cut in household bills was needed. It was a substantive, well-argued and sustained exchange. Did it take us anywhere - in terms, that is, of helping the poor guy to gather fuel? Perhaps not, at least not immediately. But it will certainly have added to the pressure upon Scottish Ministers to act - which is, after all, the function of Parliamentary scrutiny. And perhaps it will have encouraged the Wenceslas tendency in society - to proffer a helping hand, not a blind eye. Substance too in the issues raised by Ruth Davidson of the Tories and Willie Rennie of the Liberal Democrats. Ms Davidson pursued the topic of falling teacher numbers - and argued the wider case for educational reform. Ms Sturgeon talked of investment in education, including school buildings. On the topic of reform, she cited the Curriculum for Excellence. Forgive me but every time I hear mention of that particular initiative, something wicked stirs. I cannot help but recall the expert academic who mused:  \"It is not a curriculum, it is not about excellence. The only word that rings true is 'for'\". Glib, I know. But perhaps a salient reminder to those in charge that the public will tend to judge by results they can see for themselves - rather than the ambition of the forecasts or the glossiness of the accompanying brochure. Willie Rennie picked up on reports from Audit Scotland that new tax plans for Scotland may not be fully ready. (Who shouted \"Good\"?) A new body, Revenue Scotland, is being set up to cope with tax powers on the way - including the replacement for Stamp Duty - plus others which may yet arrive. Mr Rennie was far from assuaged by talk of contingency plans. What, he inquired, were they? In response, Ms Sturgeon offered a degree of detail. She had been in touch with Revenue Scotland. Key staff were already in place, others were being recruited. The IT system was in preparation. It was all fine. Yes, there were contingency plans - but they would not be needed. Mr Rennie remained sceptical. Mr Sturgeon offered further reassurance. She invited Mr Rennie to scrutinise the outcome. I think you may take it that he will.", "question": "Christmas , eh?

The admission is part of deal with prosecutors that could see Mr Hastert serve up to six months in prison. The plea represents a dramatic fall for the former senior US politician. The plea agreement, seen by the BBC, says that Mr Hastert \"agrees to enter a voluntary plea of guilty to Count 2\", which charged him with \"structuring and assisting in structuring currency transactions\". \"Structuring\" is a term used to describe the act of removing several small sums of money (in this case less than $10,000) in order to avoid rules that require banks to report large transactions. Count 1 alleged that Mr Hastert had lied to the FBI during the investigation. The agreement says that prosecutors will ask for this charge to be dismissed once the sentence for Count 2 has been imposed. Media reports suggest the charges may be connected to his history as a teacher and wrestling coach in Illinois in the 1970s. One woman has said Mr Hastert sexually abused her brother then and she believes he was not the only victim. Mr Hastert was not charged with sexual abuse as part of the case. Jolene Burdge told ABC News in June that her late brother Steve Reinboldt never came forward about the alleged abuse because he feared \"no-one would believe him\".

{"article": "The topic? Federalism, of course. It has been on Liberal (and now Lib Dem) stocks for so long, it has tended to suffer a little from benign neglect. Like much-loved socks stuffed at the back of a drawer. Liberals were sincere, of course. They meant it. They advocated federalism. But, occasionally, one was left with the impression they had not fully thought through the consequences for disparate governance in these islands. They believed in federalism. They had always believed in federalism. QED. But now? Why, federalism is the topic du jour or, more precisely, de la semaine. Only this week, not one but two senior politicians from Scotland have advanced its merits. Today we heard from Murdo Fraser, in a published paper. Mr Fraser is a thinking Conservative who blends serious contemplation with a charming capacity for ironic self-deprecation. In a report for Reform Scotland, he says federalism is an idea whose time has come. Mr Fraser says that the disparate nature of the vote in the EU referendum - Scotland and Northern Ireland Remain, England and Wales Leave - reinforces the case for further decentralisation in the UK. According to Mr Fraser, the answer is federalism. An entrenched Scottish Parliament, an English Parliament sharing time at Westminster, English city regions with administrative but not legislative power, the replacement of the House of Lords with a senate representing \"each federated part of the UK.\" I do not intend in these musings to examine this particular set of ideas too closely. My attention is more aimed at the other advocate of federalism this week, Labour's Kezia Dugdale. But perhaps I might note that there would remain practical difficulties, largely caused by the mismatch in size between Scotland and England. Federalism between those two territories would be like federating California and Connecticut. Without the other 48 US states for counter-weight. Say there is a Tory majority in England and a Labour majority in the UK. Would the Tory first minister in England, representing the vast majority of the UK population, be content to have, say, defence and foreign policy decisions taken by the Labour UK leader? Well, perhaps, that is a consequence of federating. And perhaps Murdo Fraser is right to say that his plan answers both West Lothian and the issue of the Upper House in a single bound. Let us leave that to one side for a moment, aware that it is a topic which we shall address again.  Let us instead consider the contribution advanced by Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader. She not only advocated federalism in a speech this week. She went further and suggested it might offer a solution to the Brexit dilemma for Scotland. To be fair, Ms Dugdale does not advance that case with any obvious vigour. Indeed, she notes that her proposal is set forward \"tentatively\". But she does say \"there might be a possibility that Scotland could retain its place both in the UK and in the EU\" through such a solution. That dual approach, says Ms Dugdale, was endorsed by the people of Scotland in two referendums, 2014 and this year. I have to say it is not immediately apparent to me how EU membership would be achieved via federalism. For one thing, the EU is a creature of treaty. Between member states, not their constituent parts. Germany is already a federal state. The LÃ¤nder take part in consideration of EU proposals when the topic in question forms part of their competence. But it is still Germany as a whole which is the member, bound by treaty. I cannot instantly see how, for example, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg could retain links with Brussels if Berlin had declared that Germany was leaving the EU. Further, how would federal Scottish membership of the EU operate? We are presuming that England and Wales have left the EU - and its treaty obligations - on the basis of the referendum outcome in those territories. Could Scotland alone be a federal part of the single market? How would that operate when Scotland would remain part of the UK, part of its tax system, part of its banking system, part of its monetary system? If Scotland, alone, were in the single market, would there continue to be freedom of movement of labour between Scotland and the EU? That might be thought to be a contingent element of retaining the single market. But if EU workers remained free to travel to Scotland in search of employment, how could they be prevented from popping down the M74 to England, to Manchester, to Liverpool, to London? To areas, in short, which would be by then outside the EU. Remember it is not proposed that Scotland leaves the UK, under this scenario. It is federalism, not independence. There would not be a formal border at Carlisle or Berwick. How, then, could freedom of movement operate? Ms Dugdale says there is a duty placed upon her and all of us to pay heed to the democratic mandate delivered by the people of Scotland. Which is intriguing given that an unalloyed supporter of the Union - like Ruth Davidson, for example - would say that Scotland's votes contributed to a UK mandate, rather than comprising one in their own right. Nevertheless, the Labour leader is undoubtedly right to argue that all avenues should be explored in response to the Brexit vote. Some, I would tentatively suggest, are likely to prove more productive than others.", "question": "For years , nay decades , it was a topic only touched , if at all , by eager Liberals at party conferences .

{"article": "Labour MP, John McDonnell wants the law changed to allow MPs to job-share, a move which he says would help make Parliament more diverse. This \"minor, modernising reform\" would, he claims, help women, disabled people and carers to stand as candidates and make the House of Commons more reflective of the people it serves. But the move has been described as \"bonkers\", \"outrageous\", a \"dangerous attempt at constitutional meddling\" and a \"crackpot idea\" that would make Parliament \"like a reality TV show\". In 2010 a committee, set up by the Speaker, looked into representation in Parliament and said it was a matter of justice \"that there should be a place within the House of Commons for individuals from all sections of society\". Mr McDonnell, who has cross-party support for his bill, argues that Parliament is far from representative at the moment - more than 75% of MPs are male and only a small number of MPs are disabled. He says other public services and businesses are embracing the idea of job-sharing and it is time politics followed suit. Under the plans, two people who want to stand for the same party would enter into a job-sharing agreement before an election and both their names would then appear on the ballot paper. Once in the Commons, each job-sharing MP would be entitled to a half-vote on legislation and Commons motions, with one able to cast a full vote if both MPs were in agreement. The plans would not cost the taxpayer any more as both job-sharers would share one MP's allowances between them. Although the exact way in which MPs might share their workload once elected has yet to be worked out, the Labour MP wants to get the principle of job-sharing into law - which currently lets only a \"single member\" be elected per constituency. The plan has been backed by a number of politicians, barristers, journalists, academics and comedian Jo Brand. Deborah King, who has been campaigning for the change and set up an e-petition to try and get it debated in the Commons, says it's a matter of disability rights. \"Disabled people haven't got effective representation in the United Kingdom,\" she says. \"We need 65 disabled MPs if we are to reflect the population of the UK.\" \"There are plenty of disabilities that prevent people from working full-time, but that shouldn't be a barrier.\" Robert Halfon, Conservative MP for Harlow, who has a walking disability, has chosen not to talk about his disability, choosing instead to campaign in other areas. But he has decided to back Mr McDonnell's bill, across the party divide, because he thinks Parliament needs a \"radical shake-up\". \"To be a full-time MP with a significant disability is incredibly difficult,\" he says. \"Parliament is a gruelling place. Contrary to what the media reports, the hours are long. We are often here late at night voting. \"The amount of walking you do from building to building and meeting to meeting is quite extraordinary. \"And you've got a lot activities on Friday, Saturday and Sunday in the constituency which involve additional walking around.\" Allowing job-share MPs would, Mr Halfon says, bring Parliament into line with other workplaces and widen the number of people who would think about becoming an MP. Others have raised the issue of gender equality and boosting the number of female MPs - who are seen as more likely to have caring and family responsibilities that are seen as a barrier to women standing for Parliament. Conservative MP Claire Perry has backed the notion of job-sharing cabinet posts as a \"powerful signal\" that would \"allow women to achieve their best and also recognise the complexity of many of our lives\". One disabled MP, Dame Anne Begg, who was vice chair of the Speaker's conference and has added her name to the bill, wants to see the idea \"get an airing\" but is all too aware of some of the practical problems. \"If someone's constituency is far away a job share that splits the week is not necessarily going to be possible. \"And because we often don't know what the business in the House will be until a week before, both MPs may want to be in Parliament at the same time if things they are interested in are being debated. \"Constituents may also end of going to both MPs. This happens now in the Scottish Parliament, where we have constituency members and regional members.\" Concerns have also been raised about how membership of select committees would work for job-sharers, how much time each MP would get to speak in the House and whether constituencies with two MPs would get an advantage by having more representation than those with only a single MP. Deborah King insists these kinds of difficulties can be overcome: \"These are reasonable adjustments that disabled people need made for them in the workplace. \"Workplaces up and down the country make reasonable adjustments for disabled people and the House of Commons needs to get into the 21st century.\" However, Tory MP Sir Roger Gale says the idea is simply incompatible with the role of an MP and is \"parliamentary populism and opportunism at its absolute worst\". \"Members of the public elect members of parliament. They don't elect time-sharers and it's not a job that you can do time-sharing. \"A member of parliament has to be on top of absolutely everything effecting his constituents, his postbag and his parliamentary work himself. \"It's simply not possible to simply just hand everything over to somebody else half way through the day. \"I think this is sheer lunacy and completely impractical and I cannot see it going anywhere at all. \"You become a member of parliament as a vocation and it involves very many hours of work, a huge amount of commitment and a huge amount of sacrifice on the part of people's families. \"If people aren't prepared to do that they shouldn't stand for parliament. There are many other ways in which they can serve society.\" Mr McDonnell's bill is what is known as a 10 minute rule bill, which means there is very little chance the change will become law - something which supporters like Mr Halfon accept.

{"article": "The vehicle, with Bertrand Piccard at the controls, left Mandalay in Myanmar (Burma) just after 21:00 GMT on Sunday, and is heading for Chongqing in China. The intention is to make a brief stop there, and then try to reach Nanjing on the east coast of the country. This would set up Solar Impulse for the first of its big ocean crossings - a five-day, five-night flight to Hawaii. Mission control will not make a decision on the Nanjing leg until late on Monday. The decision may rest on the state of the energy reserves held in the plane's batteries. China's air traffic authorities would like the team to start the sixth leg before dawn. But if the reserves are marginal then Solar Impulse will be held in Chongqing until the batteries can be charged. The problem with this scenario is that poor weather is forecast in the Chongqing region in the coming days, and if Solar Impulse does not leave straightaway, it could be delayed for perhaps a week. Solar Impulse took off from Mandalay International Airport in darkness at 03:36 local time, Monday (21:06 GMT Sunday). Leg five is long one - about 1,375km - and is expected to take roughly 19 hours. It would see Solar Impulse landing around midnight local time at Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport. It is 20 days since the venture got under way from Abu Dhabi. The Swiss-based project expects the circumnavigation of the globe to be completed in a total of 12 legs, with a return to the Emirate in a few months' time. Bertrand Piccard is sharing the flying duties in the single-seater plane with his business partner, Andre Borschberg. In the past month, Solar Impulse has set two world records for manned solar-powered flight. The first was for the longest distance covered on a single journey - that of 1,468km between Muscat, Oman, and Ahmedabad, India. The second was for a groundspeed of 117 knots (216km/h; 135mph), which was achieved during the leg into Mandalay, Myanmar, from Varanasi, India. No solar-powered plane has ever flown around the world. The Solar Impulse venture does however recall some other recent circumnavigation feats in aviation - albeit fuelled ones. In 1986, the Voyager aircraft became the first to fly around the world without stopping or refuelling. Piloted by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, the propeller-driven vehicle took nine days to complete its journey. Then, in 2005, this time was beaten by the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, which was solo-piloted by Steve Fossett. A jet-powered plane, GlobalFlyer completed its non-stop circumnavigation in just under three days. Solar Impulse has a wingspan of 72m - bigger than that of a 747 jumbo jet airliner - but only weighs 2.3 tonnes. Its four propellers are dependent on the electricity from 17,000 solar cells that line the top of the wings. During the night, the props' motors must call on the excess energy generated and stored during the day in lithium-ion batteries.

{"article": "Summit chairman Donald Tusk said 40,000 would be relocated to other EU states over the next two years. No agreement on a proposed quota system has been reached at the summit. The Greek debt crisis is also on the summit's agenda. Greece and its international creditors remain deadlocked after talks on Thursday. Earlier, Mr Tusk called on EU member states to share the burden of the boat loads of illegal migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean. New figures from the UN refugee agency UNHCR show that 63,000 migrants have arrived in Greece by sea this year and 62,000 in Italy. \"Leaders agreed that 40,000 persons in need will be relocated from Greece and Italy to other states over the next two years,\" Mr Tusk told reporters. \"Interior ministers will finalise the scheme by the end of July.\" Leaders also agreed to resettle another 20,000 refugees from outside the EU. The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Brussels says Hungary, which has seen thousands of migrants cross its border by land, and Bulgaria, one of the EU's poorest countries, have both been granted exemptions. The UK has opted out of the scheme, while nations in eastern Europe refused to accept set quotas, so it will be only voluntary.  This angered Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who called the plan \"modest\". Italy has sought more help from its EU partners to handle the boatloads of migrants. The migrant crisis has been high on the agenda for the EU summit, which opened on Thursday. 153,000 migrants counted on Europe's borders 149% increase from 2014 63,000  migrants reached Greece by sea 62,000 migrants reached Italy by sea 10,000   on Hungary/Serbia border in May Why is EU struggling with migrants and asylum? EU summit: Greece and migrants to dominate agenda The crisis is being fuelled by the many Syrians fleeing the civil war in their country. More than three million refugees are being housed in countries on Syria's borders - far more than the EU has taken in. But many thousands are also fleeing chaos, violence and dire poverty in Eritrea, Somalia and other countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, the impasse in the Greek debt talks has threatened to overshadow the summit. Only once agreement on economic reforms is reached between Greece and its creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - will the final â‚¬7.2bn tranche of bailout funds be released to Greece. The cash-strapped country must make a â‚¬1.6bn (Â£1.1bn) IMF debt repayment by Tuesday or face default and a possible exit from the euro. On Thursday, a meeting of eurozone finance ministers also broke up without progress on the issue. It was the fourth time in a week that the Eurogroup had met in an attempt to prevent a Greek debt default. They will meet again on Saturday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that meeting would be \"decisive\" in finding a solution. IMF head Christine Lagarde said lenders had been presented with a counter-proposal by the Greek parties \"at the last hour\" on Thursday and needed more time to assess it, Reuters reported. Also during Thursday's talks, UK Prime Minister David Cameron outlined his plans to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.

Local councils are seeking new contractors to run routes, while 200 buses and coaches are being sold off. But many passengers are still facing disruption. The company operated public and school services across north Wales, Cheshire and Shropshire. Now it has been revealed GHA's former directors, Arwyn Lloyd Davies and his brother Gareth, are involved in two companies which have won contracts from Wrexham council to run eight former services in the county borough. The subsidised services will be run by RJ's of Wem Limited and RML2418 Ltd, subject to Traffic Commissioner approval. Both companies have registered offices in Ruabon. Companies House records show the brothers have been directors since May last year. Plaid Cymru North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd said he was pleased to hear replacement services were being provided. However, he added: \"There has to be concern that the same directors that saw GHA go to the wall are also now in charge of RJs of Wem, which itself, only last December, came within a whisker of being struck off the Companies House register.\" This was a reference to the company allegedly failing to comply with Companies House rules.

The 27-year-old ploughed into the Berlingo van driven by Theresa Wade, 29, on Mull in October 2015. The court heard Wainwright had been drinking cider and whisky for eight and a half hours before the crash. He will be sentenced next month. During the trial Wainwright and his passenger,  42-year-old Jerome Lopez, had claimed that Miss Wade had been on the wrong side of the road and caused the accident but the jury did not believe them. Witnesses from Mull told how Wainwright, who was with Mr Lopez, his mother's partner, had been drinking at a hotel, a pub and a distillery in Tobermory before having another two pints of cider in the Craignure Inn. As he headed back towards Tobermory on the wrong side of the road his hire car smashed into the van driven by Miss Wade. The court heard Wainwright was on Mull, along with members of his family, visiting his sick grandmother. He had flown into Edinburgh airport and hired the Maserati. Prosecutor Tim Niven-Smith revealed that Wainwright, who worked as the first officer on the Â£6.26m yacht MY Mahogany based in the south of France, had a previous conviction for driving while unfit through drink or drugs.

{"article": "Changes to electoral boundaries in north west Wales, before the last election, meant the old Caernarfon seat disappeared to make way for Arfon, which now includes the university city of Bangor. Caernarfon Castle and Snowdon are notable landmarks in an area where tourism and the public sector are significant employers. The boundary changes boosted Labour's chances, but Plaid Cymru held on to the seat in 2010 with a majority of 1,455. This election sees a re-run of that closely fought contest between Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams and Labour's Alun Pugh. Hywel Williams was elected as MP for Caernarfon in 2001, replacing former Plaid Cymru leader Dafydd Wigley. Outside his office, in the shadow of Caernarfon Castle, he revealed he started campaigning a year and a half ago. \"I'll be very glad to see the end of this campaign and have a normal life again, but our response to it being a marginal seat is to work even harder,\" he said. A fair deal for north Wales - from Cardiff Bay and Westminster - is one of his main campaigning messages. \"It's a chain isn't it? The county council here is really strapped for cash and facing huge cuts. The money comes from Cardiff, and the money for Cardiff comes from London. \"We want to stand up for Wales and say that £1.2bn would make us equal with Scotland and go a very long way to curing our economic problems.\" Former AM and Welsh Labour minister, Alun Pugh, believes the result in Arfon is on a knife-edge. He said there were still many undecided voters \"so it's incredibly difficult to call\". On the doorstep in Bangor, his message to voters is that the election is essentially a choice between a Labour or Conservative government. \"Earlier this morning, I met a 61-year-old who's working 50 hours a week. She has two jobs and she's finding it very difficult just to pay fuel and food bills.\" \"If you want to abolish zero-hours contracts and see a substantial rise to the national minimum wage there's only one choice available on the ballot paper, and that's Labour\". The Conservative candidate is standing for election for the first time and has been finding campaigning \"really, really good fun\". In what is viewed as a two-horse race between Labour and Plaid Cymru in this seat, Anwen Barry said she was hoping to make inroads and build on the 4,500 votes her party polled last time. \"The main topic that is coming up on the doorstep is still the economy - people are still very, very worried about the economy. They want to keep it on track\", she said. Though health is devolved and therefore not directly affected by the election, she said voters were concerned about local NHS issues. \"There have been so many issues up in the north of Wales - with the Betsi Cadwaladr situation, the downgrading of special baby care - there's been a lot of problems with that and people are rightly concerned living in such a rural area\". The Liberal Democrats came fourth in Arfon five years ago. The party's candidate, Mohammed Shultan, said his priority was to secure \"decent living wages\" \"The main issue in this constituency is that people are finding it very difficult to get jobs,\" he said. \"There are no jobs at all, so my aim is to create more jobs and get the unemployment down in this area.\" UKIP's Simon Wall claims his party is getting a positive response from voters in Arfon. He said people were fed up of \"the ping-pong politics\" between other parties, and looked to UKIP as \"a party of change\". \"Our EU membership and our right to self-determination as a country is a huge issue for people on the doors,\" he said. \"The £56 million a day that we're sending to the EU, that's a huge issue for people.\" The Socialist Labour Party is also standing in Arfon, and you can see the full list of candidates here.", "question": "Plaid Cymru-held Arfon has fewer constituents than any other seat on the UK @placeholder , and Labour says it is battling for every single vote .", "option_0": "region", "option_1": "assembly", "option_2": "mainland", "option_3": "beach", "option_4": "show", "label": 2}
{"article": "Qatar's Foreign Minister Khalid al-Attiya set the tone of the Gulf Co-operation Council's Foreign Ministers' meeting with his opening words, saying it was being held in \"very exceptional circumstances and challenges that have been unprecedented\". The main topic of Monday's talks has been the US effort to allay Arab concerns over the 14 July nuclear deal with Iran. Saudi Arabia and its closest allies fear that the deal will make it more, not less, likely, that Tehran will eventually build a nuclear bomb. They also suspect that with up to $150bn (Â£96bn) of newly-unfrozen funds, Iran's more extremist elements will step up their support for militant Shia groups around the region. A separate trilateral meeting between the US, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers has been focusing on Syria. But Gulf Arab governments also have mounting security concerns closer to home. Despite being the most prosperous and stable part of the Arab world, the six Gulf Arab states now find themselves facing a twin threat of domestic terrorist attacks from two ideologically opposed foes: Sunni and Shia extremists. In late July, Bahrain suffered one of the most serious attacks on its police force. An improvised bomb ambushed a police convoy, killing two officers and injuring others. Investigators say the explosive used was of military quality and similar to explosives the authorities say have been intercepted coming from Iran. They believe this latest device came from Shia militants in Iraq, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. Bahrain has long accused Iran - and specifically elements of its intelligence security apparatus - of promoting violent unrest in the island state. Opposition figures say the government has often talked up this threat as a pretext for cracking down on protests and stifling any challenge to the Sunni monarchy by the Shia, who form a majority of the indigenous population. But Western diplomats share Bahrain's concerns, following a number of recent discoveries of explosives and weapons coming in by sea and over the causeway from Saudi Arabia, that Bahrain is being targeted by violent Shia extremists outside the country. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also highly suspicious of Iran's activities in the region, which is why their armed forces have been actively helping Yemeni troops push the allegedly Iranian-backed Houthi rebels out of Aden. But the deadliest terrorist threat in the Gulf right now comes from the Sunni jihadists of so-called Islamic State (IS). In the space of five weeks this summer the Najd Province group, an IS affiliate, carried out three suicide bombings - two in Saudi Arabia and one in Kuwait. In all, 52 people were killed and hundreds injured. In each case the targets were Shia Muslims, murdered in their mosques as they attended Friday prayers. The jihadists of IS consider the Shia to be heretics. Analysts believe the aim of these bombings is to provoke a violent response from the Shia, setting off a sectarian conflict that will recruit more of the Gulf's Sunni citizens into the ranks of IS. After hitting Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, experts believe Bahrain is the next likely target. The numbers of IS supporters in the Gulf is disturbingly high and probably far greater than official figures suggest. In July the Saudi authorities announced they had arrested 431 suspected IS members, on top of a further 93 announced in April. Aymen Deen, the former al-Qaeda operative and expert on IS, believes there has been a recent change of strategy by the militant group. He says that rather than encouraging Gulf Arab supporters to come to Syria, the IS leadership is now telling them to remain in their own countries to plan attacks there, on the authorities, on the Shia and on Westerners.", "question": "If Gulf Arab foreign ministers tell US Secretary of State John Kerry their full list of fears this week then he may need to extend his current visit to Doha .

{"article": "On the bustling Avenue Reforma in the capital of Guatemala, in Central America, he has to keep his wits about him. He has to be prepared at all times for the very real threat of armed robbery, a kidnapping attempt, or even murder. With an average of 13 murders per day across the country last year, Guatemala is one of the most dangerous nations in the world, outside of a warzone. Bedevilled by drug gangs, grinding poverty and an abundance of guns, violent crime rates are sky high. In the capital, no suburb \"including the upscale shopping, tourist and residential areas\" are \"immune to daytime assaults\", warns the US State Department. It adds that the situation is a \"serious concern\", not helped by \"weak law enforcement and judicial systems\", or the country's \"legacy of societal violence\" - a reference to the Guatemalan Civil War that ran from 1960 to 1996. Under such circumstances it is perhaps no surprise that the country's private security sector is booming. \"The demand is always increasing,\" says Alredo Rosenberg, a manager at one such security firm, Sedicop. \"Unfortunately this comes from the problem of insecurity that we all experience as Guatemalans.\" Sedicop is one of almost 100 legally registered private security firms protecting citizens and businesses in Guatemala. A similar number of other security businesses work without government approval. In total, there are estimated to be as many as 150,000 private security guards in the country, compared with a police force of just 30,000. This is in a country with a population of 15.5 million, of which 4.5 million live in and around the capital. Sedicop and its 500 employees offer a range of services. If a business would like to see a shipment safely delivered, Sedicop can send a patrol car to drive with the van or lorry, for a price of $2 (Â£1.50) per km. Want a security guard to watch a business premises? Prices start from $545 a month. Need a bodyguard? That's from $775 a month. \"People will pay for security,\" says Sedicop operations director Hans Castillo. \"That's because it's a person's life we are talking about.\" For fans of US heavy metal band Metallica, the group's 2010 concert in Guatemala City was an incredible night full of crunching guitar riffs and pounding drum solos. But for Julio Colon, the outdoor gig of 27,000 people simply screamed \"security hazard\". Mr Colon, a manager at private security firm Seguridad Integral, was given overall responsibility for the safety of the event. He equipped the football stadium where the concert took place with metal detectors, formulated an exit plan, and ensured that security personnel with walkie-talkies were stationed everywhere. Thankfully the event passed without incident. With people in Guatemala wanting life to go on as normal despite the daily security concerns, concerts and football matches continue to be held in the country. And Seguridad Integral has now provided security at thousands of such events since it was founded in 1990. \"At the time there weren't any companies that specialised in covering large events,\" says Mr Colon. \"Overseeing an event where there is movement of a lot of people in a few hours is very different to just looking after a building.\" While most security firms in Guatemala provide general security services for companies, Seguridad Integral continues to specialise in large events, carving out its own niche. It charges as much as $26,000 per event. Mr Colon says that demand has steadily grown, and that the firm now has 150 employees. Such is the continuing demand in Guatemala for private security firms, that it has attracted entrants from overseas. Ohad Steinhart moved to the country in 1994 to work as a firearms instructor after completing his service in the Israel Defence Forces. About two years later he opened his own private security firm, Decision Ejecutiva, which offers personalised security packages, mainly to Guatemalan, Mexican and American businesspeople. At the time his clients' biggest concern was kidnapping. However, Mr Steinhart says he needs to continue to adapt to an ever-changing security situation in Guatemala. He adds that in recent years there has been a big rise in the number of extortion cases. \"In this country when you close one hole, another two open,\" he says in regard to Guatemalan security issues. Decision Ejecutiva charges from $1,500 per month for a personal bodyguard, and now employs 300 people. While Guatemala now has more than 200 private security firms, Mr Steinhart says there is ample work for all of them. And this situation is not likely to change any time soon. Adriana Beltran, a security expert at US think tank Washington Office On Latin America, says that private security firms are so in demand in Guatemala because people don't believe that the police or other state institutions can protect them. \"Those who can afford it turn to private security firms for protection,\" she says. Back on Avenue Reforma the security guard is still walking back and forth, and doesn't stop to talk. He was hired by a building that has cafes and restaurants at street level, with offices above containing a law firm, travel agent and TV station.

{"article": "But the 75-year-old law professor has played a key role in the impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff. Under Brazil's constitution, he became acting president after the Senate voted in favour of launching an impeachment trial against Ms Rousseff, suspending her. Mr Temer is a discreet politician who seems always to be hovering around the centre of everything important, yet - up until now - never in the spotlight. But recently he has come out of the shadows, as a skilled politician intent on ending the Rousseff presidency and beginning a new era in Brazil. Mr Temer's most notable achievement as a politician has been to help the country's biggest political party - the PMDB - form coalitions with every president in the past two decades. He is currently party president. He presided over Brazil's lower house of Congress during the years of the Fernando Henrique Cardoso government (1995-2002), when Brazil underwent a liberal programme of privatisations and opening-up of the economy. And under Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2002-10, known as Lula) and Ms Rousseff, he has played a key role in helping push forward their Workers' Party agenda of state-led investments. But rather like his party, which has not held outright power for over two decades, Mr Temer has always been a kingmaker, but never king. Both party and man avoid clear ideological positions, which leaves them in a comfortable position for negotiating their participation in coalitions of any political colour. As Brazil's political crisis worsened and Ms Rousseff's Workers' Party bore most of the brunt for the many scandals in the country, the PMDB saw an opportunity to finally seize power. For most of last year, as Ms Rousseff's situation deteriorated, Mr Temer kept a low profile. But in December, things began to change. The then-speaker of Brazil's lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, also a PMDB politician, opened impeachment proceedings against Ms Rousseff for allegedly doctoring government public finances - an allegation the president denies. A few days later, a bitter letter written by Mr Temer to Ms Rousseff was leaked to the press, in which he complained that he had been neglected in making key decisions in the coalition. In March, the PMDB officially abandoned the coalition. In April, the battle between Mr Temer and Ms Rousseff for Brazil's top job finally came out into the open. Mr Temer sent a WhatsApp recording to a few MPs with a draft of the speech he had prepared in case Ms Rousseff lost the 17 April impeachment vote in the lower house. In it, he outlined how Brazil needed a \"government to save the country\". Mr Temer said the message was sent by mistake, but Ms Rousseff accused him of deliberately releasing his speech. Furthermore she accused both Mr Temer and Mr Cunha of being \"chief and vice-chief of a coup\" against her. Both men denied they were conspiring for Brazil's top job. In the days leading to the 17 April vote, both Mr Temer and Ms Rousseff met dozens of lawmakers, with some accounts of tough negotiations of jobs and promises in exchange for votes in Congress from both sides. So what could Brazilians expect now? In October 2015, the PMDB launched a manifesto called Bridge to the Future, which outlined what policies they would defend within the coalition. Most policies are popular with businesspeople and investors and would go a lot deeper into rebalancing Brazil's budget than President Rousseff has done so far - such as creating a minimum age for retirement, changing the scope of social programmes, opening up the oil sector, making labour laws more flexible and cutting mandatory spending in health and education. However, many of those policies are likely to find a lot of resistance. \"It is the type of programme that even a government that was elected by the people with total legitimacy from the vote would have a very hard time approving in the middle of such a big crisis,\" says economist Laura Carvalho, from USP university. \"They will try to push that through and there's going to be a lot of resistance from social movements and labour unions.\" Mr Temer has signalled he may approach the opposition PSDB party to secure a majority in Congress - but that would be a hard sell for many, as the majority of Brazilians rejected the party in the 2014 elections. There are also questions of how Mr Temer would handle corruption investigations, as his party features prominently in many scandals, including the speakers of the Senate, Renan Calheiros, and the former speaker of the lower, Mr Cunha. Mr Cunha was suspended from the post of lower house speaker earlier this month over allegations he tried to obstruct a corruption investigation against him. So far Ms Rousseff has refrained from intervening in the Federal Police and court investigations into alleged corruption at state oil firm Petrobras - even when the scandal caused serious damage to her party. Would Mr Temer do the same? He is not under direct investigation, but Mr Cunha - a powerful ally who has led much of the impeachment process that may benefit Mr Temer in the end - is alleged to hold millions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts. Mr Cunha denies the allegations. There is a public outcry against Mr Cunha, so Mr Temer will be under pressure to turn against him and keep investigations independent. During many occasions throughout the current crisis, Ms Rousseff has stressed that she was elected by 54.5 million Brazilians in 2014 and therefore has legitimacy to lead the country. As her vice-president, Mr Temer indirectly received the same votes. He will now lead the whole nation - even those who until a few weeks back did not even know who he was.", "question": "Until recently most Brazilians would have @placeholder to recognise Michel Temer if they were shown a picture of the vice - president .", "option_0": "returned", "option_1": "vowed", "option_2": "had", "option_3": "struggled", "option_4": "wanted", "label": 3}

A former bodyguard, the 6ft 4in (1.93m) Duncan was an imposing figure who played a wide variety of action roles and also voiced animated parts. His versatility saw him team up with Bruce Willis to save the Earth in Armageddon, then play it for laughs in Will Ferrell's racing comedy Talladega Nights. In recent years he was seen in US sitcom Two and a Half Men and could be heard in animated comedy Family Guy. But he will be remembered primarily for his role as John Coffey  a convicted murderer possessed of extraordinary healing powers, in the adaptation of Stephen King's novel The Green Mile. His performance won him a nomination as best supporting actor and kick-started an acting career that only began once he gave up bodyguard work in his thirties. The film's director Frank Darabont described Duncan as \"one of the finest people I've ever had the privilege to work with or know\". \"Michael was the gentlest of souls - an exemplar of decency, integrity and kindness,\" he said in a statement. \"The sadness I feel is inexpressible.\" Duncan, who was born in Chicago in 1957, died on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

{"article": "But which companies have managed to stand out in this important market? The BBC asked global brand research company Millward Brown to find the 20 most powerful foreign brands in China, the ones that have gone in and succeeded where many others have failed. We then asked those companies to tell us the secrets of their success. Between 2011 and 2013, Millward Brown carried out almost 60,000 face-to-face and online interviews with consumers in 10 Chinese cities as part of their market research in the country. The company then analysed its findings for the BBC, ranking brands on how \"meaningful\", \"different\" or \"salient\" they were and how easily they came into consumers' minds. Thirteen of the top 20 brands are from the US, two from Germany, two from France, one from Italy and one from the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever. South Korea's Samsung is the only Asian brand on the list. The opportunity is there for the taking. Millward Brown has found that Chinese consumers once valued low prices above any other factor when making choices. But a mix of higher living standards and falling trust in local brands means people are looking to international brands more. \"Our research shows that in the last three years, trust in Chinese brands has eroded quite dramatically,\" says Millward Brown's Peter Walshe. \"This is an opportunity for well-known and well-supported international brands to make their move as consumers start to value quality and experience as much as price.\" So how do you create a brand that works in China? We asked the companies on our list and 11 of them; Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Nike, L'Oreal, Apple, Samsung, Adidas, Armani, Omo, VW and the number one brand KFC gave us the lowdown on how it's done. All of the brands have been pioneers in China, entering before 2000. Coca-Cola has been there since 1927 and by 1948 was shifting more than a million bottles a year in Shanghai, making it the biggest city for the company outside the US. Nike says it's been there since 1981, VW started in 1983, KFC in 1987 and McDonald's followed in 1990, so getting in early seems to be a key factor. The Chinese market is changing quickly and many of the companies are learning to keep up. \"Everyone is learning about how they need to work with changing social attitudes and continuous aspirational trade-ups, even the Chinese themselves.\" according to McDonald's. \"Never assume what works for your mature markets will work for China. Success comes for those who stay relevant to the needs of the Chinese consumer.\" Other brands, such as Unilever's detergent Omo, go in with a fully researched understanding of the behaviours of consumers. It found that in many markets a family would use three buckets to wash clothes but Chinese consumers used five buckets for their laundry and Omo pitched their brand accordingly. Nike is developing products around Chinese habits and sports, which it then plans to sell in other markets. Giorgio Armani says that when he went into China, he painted the door of the store in Beijing red as he thought it would appeal more to his customers. Now Armani says he doesn't really change his offering in China from other markets as the customers want the Western style he sells internationally. Having got in early, many of the companies are building on that advantage. Some of the numbers are staggering. KFC has 4,400 restaurants in 850 cities and will add another 700 this year. McDonald's says it is opening 10 restaurants a week and during 2012-15 Coca-Cola will invest $4bn expanding in China. But it's not all fast food and fizzy drinks. Apple is doubling the number of stores in China in the next two years. For German carmaker Volkswagen, China is its biggest market, representing a third of its global business and it has seven new production plants in the pipeline. Many of the brands that spoke to us stressed the importance of looking beyond the coastal cities of Shanghai and Beijing to the staggering growth and new consumers in cities across the country. Both Samsung and L'Oreal tailor their approach in China to different regions. Adidas says of the 800 stores it opened in China last year, half of them were in these so-called \"lower-tier\" cities. It has found very different attitudes in the north and the south of the country but says even in inland cities, consumers are increasingly looking to buy aspirational foreign brands. Running a business in China is difficult to do from outside the country, and many of these multinationals tell us that their success is built on finding the best Chinese talent and joint venture partners. KFC, L'Oreal, VW and Adidas all say that hiring and then training the best local talent helps them understand their customers better.", "question": "The masses of new middle - @placeholder consumers in China are one of the big targets for global companies battling the sluggish economies of Europe and North America .", "option_0": "market", "option_1": "style", "option_2": "class", "option_3": "age", "option_4": "level", "label": 2}

{"article": "And that's left many questioning the underlying health of the global economy and wondering what comes next. At heart, anyone grappling with this issue is really asking themselves three inter-related questions: how sharp is China's slowdown? What happens next to commodities? And when will the US Federal Reserve raise interest rates? The direction of China's stock market is very much a third order issue - despite all the attention over the last week. It matters little to investors outside China, as foreign ownership is still very limited - except perhaps as a gauge of sentiment. It matters only a little more to Chinese investors - who are still a tiny subset of the Chinese people. Its wild gyrations certainly don't tell us much about the underlying health of the Chinese economy. So on to the first real question - how sharply has China slowed? Growth is certainly down from the double digit levels seen in the last decade. Officially the economy is growing at a still healthy 7% a year, but many independent analysts put the real number at closer to 5%. That is still a healthy rate of growth for a country at China's stage of development - and given that China's economy is now much bigger than it was, 5% in 2015 contributes to global demand as much as 10% of a much smaller economy did earlier in the century. China's economy was always going to slow, but to understand the panic about this (and panic really is the word) one has to assume one of two things. Either investors hadn't really previously discounted the fact that growth would really slow, or they are worried that the slowdown is sharper - something below 5%. The latest bout of global risk aversion was kicked off by China's surprise decision to devalue its currency against the dollar. Many took that as a sign of panic amongst Chinese policy makers - an attempt to kickstart exports and boost growth. The decision was badly communicated and coincided with thin (and usually more volatile) August markets. But for what it's worth, it strikes me as a fundamentally sensible move to partially uncouple the renminbi (RMB) from a rising dollar at a time when the dollar is likely to continue rising and other Asian currencies are weak. That doesn't amount to an abandonment of China's \"rebalancing\" away from exports and investment and towards consumption, but a prudent step to take more control of their own monetary policy rather than being shackled (through a semi-pegged currency) to steps taken by the US Federal Reserve. Bad Chinese manufacturing data last week rekindled those fears about the extent of the slowdown, but other data (especially consumption) point to healthier growth. If growth is chugging along at 5%, then China has the difficult task of managing an economic transition and the shape of the world economy will begin to shift but fundamentally global growth isn't in danger. If though it's actually as low as 3% or even 1%, then the recent asset price falls are only the start. Secondly, there's the question of commodities - and especially oil. Commodity prices are at their lowest level since 1999. This is the core of the debate between the \"deflationists\" and the \"reflationists\". To some that signals a world economy in serious trouble - weak demand for commodities signalling a slowdown in growth. But to others this is mainly a supply side story - just look at oil, where US production has soared. And cheaper commodities create what might be counter-intuitively thought of as \"disinflationary force for reflation\" - lower fuel and food prices boost real household disposable incomes, allowing more money to spend on other goods. Cheap petrol has been a motor of UK and European growth this year. It certainly looks like Saudi Arabia's decision to maintain high production levels last year - read by many as an attempt to drive higher-cost US shale producers out of the market - has failed. US shale really has two motors. The first was high oil prices which made production economically tenable - that motor has failed. But there was a second: easy access to credit to maintain cash flows and finance growth. And that motor, despite some signs of spluttering, still seems to be working. Faced with lower prices, US producers are focusing on their best fields and raising their efficiency. If commodity prices stay low then - all things being equal - this is a boon to importers in developed countries and a drag on emerging economy exporters. Finally there's the question of when the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. The markets had been expecting that to happen in September - but that now looks less likely. Market turmoil, slower global growth, weaker commodity prices and a stronger dollar (and hence less inflationary pressure) all give ammunition to those urging the Fed to wait. On the other hand, to back down isn't cost free. It may appear to \"reward\" bad behaviour in the markets - the Fed has many responsibilities but supporting stock prices isn't one of them. The central bank may be reluctant to delay if it is seen as an attempt to do this - which might encourage excessive risk taking in the future. Managing the transition from near-zero rates to more \"normal\" policy was always going to be tricky. The Fed (like other monetary policy makers) has staked a lot on communication - by making clear that rates would rise in a gradual and controlled way to a lower level than in the past it sought to manage the fallout from a change in policy. To delay hiking now may damage the credibility of that communication effort (a September rise having been well flagged in advance) and make the eventual task harder. Many economists are now pushing their Fed hike-timing estimates out to December or even March next year. A lot may depend on how the markets play out in the weeks ahead. These are the three real questions facing the global economy. It's easy to get caught up in moves in the markets over the course of a single day or how currencies and stock indices performed over a week. I know this as I get caught up in this most days. But it's always worth stepping back and looking at the big picture. UK and US growth is relatively solid - not spectacular but solid. The Eurozone seems to be staging a weak recovery - though better than other years, supported by aggressive monetary policy. Low commodity prices are an almost unambiguously good thing for the developed world. But alongside that healthier picture for the developed world is a much weaker one for the emerging world. Global growth still hasn't returned to the levels seen before 2008 and maybe it won't. The pattern of global growth is changing.

The North Norfolk constituency contains the holiday resorts of Sheringham, Cromer and Wells-next-the-Sea, along with the small inland towns of Holt, North Walsham and Fakenham, and many more villages. The constituency has a high number of elderly people, with 4% of the population over 85 years, making pensions and social care key issues. It is also an agricultural area and issues such subsidies for farming after Brexit will figure high in many people's minds. North Norfolk had the rare distinction of being an agricultural seat which elected a Labour MP between 1945 and 1970 and had a strong tradition of organised agricultural trade unionism. The Conservative Sir Ralph Howell took the seat in 1970 and it remained Tory until Norman Lamb of the Liberal Democrats won the seat in 2001.

Both would be great. I have demonstrated my passion and commitment to my community, North Norfolk, for the last 16 years. As an MP, I have worked hard to give a voice to those who are disadvantaged and marginalised in society - and in particular, fighting on behalf of those with mental ill health. A bold solution to the crisis in NHS and social care. I want an NHS we can be proud of on its 70th birthday - properly funded, treating mental and physical conditions with equal priority, and joined-up with a compassionate social care system that meets today's needs. I would deliver a fairer, sustainable way of funding health and social care to ensure dignity in old age, including the cap on care costs I fought for as health minister. I would invest more in children's education, so that they can flourish and make the most of their talents. I re-mortgaged my house to fund a grime album.  My eldest son, Archie, is a music producer who discovered the artist Tinchy Stryder. We helped him launch his breakthrough album, which spawned three Top 10 singles including two that topped the charts. Talented man! Jo Grimond.

{"article": "The company that runs HMP Northumberland insists the prison is under control and says the same number of layoffs would have been had it remained in the public sector. But a series of incidents, since French multinational Sodexo took over in December 2013, have attracted criticism from staff, MPs and union officials. Paul Miller was an officer at the 1,300-capacity Acklington jail for 23 years and picked up awards for his service. \"I loved my job. I loved the banter. I had a great rapport with the prisoners. I was proud to wear the crown on the uniform,\" he said. He, along with about 200 of the 588 staff, took voluntary redundancy earlier this year. The 48-year-old now runs a photo booth business with his wife Julie but he says if the prison had stayed in the public sector, he would have remained in the service. \"I think it's immoral to run this for money,\" he said. \"Why should somebody make profit out of somebody's misfortune?\" Labour MP Ian Lavery, whose Wansbeck constituency is nearby, said he was \"vehemently opposed\" to privatisation of the Prison Service. But the prison was not without shortcomings before the contract was put out to tender. Its last inspection report in 2012 said a third of prisoners were locked up during the working day with nothing to do. This, says Sodexo, is one of the areas in which it is making progress, as it works to fulfil its commitment to bring more work into the prison. But the 2012 report also found the prison was relatively safe and \"respectful\". In a year which saw a group of prisoners take over a wing, a member of staff hospitalised in an assault and a small group of prisoners running riot after fire broke out in six cells, Mr Miller also says one of his friends was headbutted by a prisoner. Mr Lavery said: \"It looks very much as if it's a powder keg. I'm worried a member of staff is going to get seriously harmed.\" It is unclear if there has been a genuine increase in violence, or whether there has simply been greater scrutiny since privatisation. The Ministry of Justice, which holds the figures on the number of assaults, has refused to release them for the period after December 2013. \"Don't get me wrong, it did happen in the Prison Service as well but not in these numbers,\" Mr Miller said. \"We always felt we were good at interacting with the prisoners and there was a lot of respect both ways.\" But he believes there are now too few staff to forge relationships with prisoners and keep control of them. \"When I first went to HMP Northumberland, we had 60 prisoners with a senior officer and five officers running a wing,\" he said. By the time he left, this had dropped to two officers in charge of a wing with no senior officer, he said. Frances Crook, chief executive of campaigning charity the Howard League for Penal Reform, said staffing levels were \"particularly concerning\". She said 2014 had been \"a year to forget\" for the prison. In a statement, Sodexo said it constantly reviewed staffing levels and had hired 27 new officers as a result. Sir Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat MP whose Berwick constituency includes the prison and who is chair of the Justice Committee, said staffing was a concern. But he pointed out that when the HMP Northumberland contract was put out to tender, the public sector bid also included a planned staff reduction of 200. \"I visit a lot of prisons, some of them are public sector, some of them are private sector and there's good and bad in both,\" he said. \"The thing that tends to make prisons not work well is the immediate aftermath of any kind of change. \"There has been a general increase in violence across the prison system and it's clearly affected HMP Northumberland.\" Staff cuts have been made across the board and government figures recently released showed a 15% increase in attacks on officers across the prison system, since the coalition came into power. Sodexo sees some of the criticism it has received over its running of HMP Northumberland as unfair. In a statement, the company said: \"We're disappointed with the negative perception of HMP Northumberland when our experienced staff do fantastic work in a challenging environment. \"Our highest priority is to run a safe prison and this is never an area of compromise. \"Criticism of staffing levels has taken the focus away from HMP Northumberland as a working prison. \"We are committed to reducing reoffending and more prisoners are now working in the prison for longer hours than ever before as part of our resettlement strategy.\" The public will get a sense of the current situation in the jail next month, when inspectors who visited in September publish their report.

{"article": "Who were these men and - 100 years later - has there been a lasting legacy from their deaths? The vast majority of those who drowned or died from hypothermia were South Africans recruited to work as manual labourers on the Western Front. Many had signed up hoping they would win more political freedoms if they demonstrated their willingness to help the British Empire's war effort. The Mendi had already completed a 34-day journey from Cape Town when it sailed past the Isle of Wight in foggy weather on 21 February. At about 05:00 GMT, a Royal Mail packet-boat, the SS Darro, ploughed into the Mendi at full speed, smashing a 20ft (6m) hole on her starboard side. It ripped through to crowded holds where men were sleeping in tightly-packed tiers of bunks. A total of 646 people died. Only 267 survived the sinking; 195 black men, two of the four white officers and 10 of the 17 white NCOs. From the safety of the Darro, Captain Harry Stump stood by and watched - but for reasons that are still murky, did nothing to save the lives of the men. Why didn't he help? The SS Darro sustained only minor damage and there was plenty of room on board, according to the official investigation.

Maybe he was confused or lost his nerve. \"Was is because the men were black? There has certainly been speculation to that effect, but no firm conclusion. In South Africa, people believed that.\" The SANLC was formed in response to a British request for manual workers on the Western Front. The men were to have become part of a huge multinational labour force. Their role was to build the railways, trenches, camps and roads upon which the Allied war effort depended. They were not allowed to bear arms, were kept segregated, and were not eligible for military honours. Following the disaster, bodies continued to be washed up on both sides of the Channel for several weeks. The news of the sinking reached South Africa two weeks after it happened. Prime Minister General Louis Botha rose in parliament to inform the nation, and the house unanimously carried a motion conveying \"parliament's sadness\". Botha praised the labour corps for \"doing everything possible\" in the war and for their \"loyalty to the flag and the King\". This deference did not stretch to awarding medals to any of the black servicemen - living or dead - from the South African Native Labour Force. Such honours were reserved for white officers only. In the years that followed, the disaster was not made much of in South Africa. Indeed, some African National Congress (ANC) leaders viewed war veterans as \"sell-outs\", according to Prof Grundlingh, and felt \"embarrassed\" about black military service. Col Daisy Tshiloane, a former member of the ANC's military wing, said she had learned the story of the Mendi in \"ANC camps\". Speaking as a South African deputy defence advisor in 2014, she said she found it \"very hurtful\" that \"so many black African lives meant nothing\". The story was not included in school curriculums set by the country's white rulers but was passed on from generation to generation, says author Fred Khumalo. \"It's a huge gap in our history,\" says the writer of Dancing the Death Drill, a novel based on the sinking. The book's title comes from an unconfirmed but persistent anecdote about Reverend Isaac Wauchope Dyobha, a pastor on the ship. He was a prominent member of a group of East Cape African intellectuals, who encouraged their compatriots to join the Labour Corps in the hope the show of loyalty would benefit black people politically. The story goes that he told the doomed men: \"Be quiet and calm, my countrymen, for what is taking place now is exactly what you came to do. \"You are going to die, but that is what you came to do. \"Brothers, we are drilling the drill of death. \"I, a Xhosa, say you are all my brothers, Zulus, Swazis, Pondos, Basutos, we die like brothers. \"We are the sons of Africa. \"Raise your cries, brothers, for though they made us leave our weapons at our home, our voices are left with our bodies. He then led them in a barefoot dance - the \"death drill\" - drumming their feet on the deck as the ship wallowed and sank. Historians have varyingly described the legend as \"pure nationalist mythology based on African oral tradition\" or containing a \"solid core of truth\". Other stories of heroism include that of Joseph Tshite, a schoolmaster from near Pretoria, who encouraged those around him with hymns and prayers until he died. A white sergeant was supported by two black compatriots, who swam with him and found place for him on a raft. The site of the wreck was discovered by an English diver in 1974 and an official memorial was erected by the South African government in 1986 at Delville Wood in France. By then, South Africa's black majority had lived under decades of apartheid rule, the hopes that loyalty in WW1 would lead to greater political rights having been long dashed. However, in post-apartheid South Africa, the story is now better known. A Mendi medal for bravery was established in 2003 and a modern South African navy ship bears its name. And the controversy over the actions - or lack of - by Cpt Stump rumbles on. He was found entirely to blame for the sinking. An official report ruled he was going too fast and had not sounded a warning whistle in the fog. According to Prof Grundlingh, the captain never explained why he did not help the stricken men on board the Mendi, nor express any regret or remorse. Yet despite calls for him to be jailed, the only sanction he faced was to have his licence suspended for a year. \"He must have heard the cries proceeding from the water for hours [after the accident],\" the report into the disaster said. \"There was nothing to have prevented him from sending boats on the then smooth water... had he done so, many more lives would have been saved. \"His inaction was inexcusable.\"", "question": "In the pre-dawn darkness of a February morning in 1917 , a ship carrying hundreds of black South African men was sunk in the English Channel .

{"article": "Cologne police also made \"serious mistakes\" in not calling reinforcements and the way they informed the public. More than 500 criminal complaints were filed, 40% alleging sexual assault. Apparent retaliatory attacks in Cologne on Sunday were condemned by the government as inexcusable. The Pope meanwhile said Europe's \"humanistic spirit\" risked being undermined. The \"immense influx\" of migrants was causing problems, he said, but the continent had the means to strike a balance between protecting its citizens and helping migrants. North Rhine-Westphalia state's interior minister Ralf Jaeger said that recent arrivals in Germany were among the suspects in the attacks, which took place in central Cologne, in the area of the cathedral and the main railway station. Nineteen individuals are currently under investigation by the state police in connection with the attacks, NRW's interior ministry says in a report (in German), none of them German nationals. Those 19 suspects include 14 men from Morocco and Algeria. Ten of the suspects are asylum seekers, nine of whom arrived in Germany after September 2015. The other nine are possibly in Germany illegally, the interior ministry says. The scale of the assaults on women in Cologne and other German cities has shocked Germany. Mr Jaeger is himself under political pressure. On Friday he fired Cologne's police chief, Wolfgang Albers. Addressing state MPs on Monday, Mr Jaeger criticised police for not calling for reinforcements on the night, and also for the way they informed the public about the investigation in the days after the events. His report details how a group of around 1,000 men of North African and Arabic origin gathered on 31 December. Smaller groups formed, surrounding women, then threatening and attacking them, he said. These groups were predominately made up of North African men who had travelled to Cologne from different cities. \"After the intoxication with drugs and alcohol came violence,\" said Mr Jaeger. \"It culminated in the acting out of fantasies of sexual omnipotence. That must be severely punished.\" Around 1.1 million asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015. Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policy has come under criticism since the attacks. Riot police used water cannon to disperse anti-migrant protesters in Cologne on Saturday. On Sunday evening, a group of around 20 people attacked six Pakistanis, two of whom had to be treated in hospital. Two Syrian men were attacked in two separate incidents. Three men from Guinea were assaulted in a fourth attack, police said. Crime division chief Norbert Wagner said police were investigating whether the attacks were co-ordinated on social media. Justice Minister Heiko Maas condemned those attacks, saying: \"As abominable as the crimes in Cologne and other cities were, one thing remains clear: there is no justification for blanket agitation against foreigners.\" He said it appeared that some people \"appear just to have been waiting for the events of Cologne\". Mrs Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said \"nothing excuses\" retaliatory assaults on immigrants. Monday's report into the attacks in Cologne says that the combination of group sexual violence with robbery had not previously been seen in Germany. It notes that similar crimes took place in other parts of Germany on 31 December, including in Hamburg. The report describes a modus operandi known as \"taharrush gamea\" in Arabic, meaning group sexual harassment in crowds, and compares it to incidents reported in Cairo's Tahrir Square at the time of the Egyptian revolution.

The passport had to get to customer Hugh Munro in Rye, Sussex, by 09:00 BST the following day so that his planned visit to Amsterdam could go ahead. Mr Shepherd said his instinct was to \"keep the customer happy\". Mr Munro was heading to the Dutch capital for a charity board meeting after stopping off at his sister's house in Rye. Mr Shepherd, who has been postmaster at Stratton Store for 11 months, said: \"I knew it was vital he had it. \"His neighbour brought it in.

{"article": "Today could be just another day he may have felt the same, as events moved with dizzying speed. First, it was the news that the government had reassigned 350 police officers in the capital Ankara to different posts (mostly demotions) by a government decree published at midnight. They included chiefs of financial crimes, anti-smuggling, cybercrime and organised crime units. This was followed by other breaking news - a simultaneous corruption operation in five cities across Turkey, with more than 25 people, businessmen and state officials, detained on suspicion of bribery and fraudulent tenders. Then the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK), which appoints senior members of the judiciary, decided to investigate Istanbul's newly appointed police chief and several prosecutors overseeing the corruption probe started in December last year. Later, the top police officers in charge of the operation conducted earlier in the day were dismissed from their posts. An opposition MP called for the president to intervene in the crisis. A former Turkish president had once famously said \"24 hours is a very long time in politics\". Even he probably could not have predicted such a day. All these moves come as the AKP government led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan tries to contain the massive political fallout from the corruption probe into four government ministers, several businessmen and bankers. This has become the biggest challenge to the AKP government's 11-year rule and Mr Erdogan has been quick to retaliate, condemning the probe as a \"dirty plot\" to topple his government. Mr Erdogan said he would not permit \"a state within a state\", a phrase apparently referring to the movement led by the highly influential Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the US since 1999. Mr Gulen is said to have millions of followers across the world and extensive influence over the state bureaucracy, the police force and the judiciary in Turkey. The government accuses him and his movement, referred to as \"Cemaat\" in Turkey, of being behind the graft probe - a charge Mr Gulen denies. However, the recent crisis in Turkey is increasingly seen as not only a corruption investigation which is alleged to involve the closest circles of Mr Erdogan, but a bitter power struggle between AKP and Cemaat. Some believe that Cemaat's support was crucial in the election victories of AKP for three consecutive terms; that they have helped the government in curbing the powers of the military by their influence within the judiciary with the help of high-profile cases like Ergenekon and Sledgehammer which saw hundreds of military officers - including the previous chief of staff of the armed forces - jailed; that as the \"common enemy\" was driven out of the picture they started to become wary of each other's power and hence a fight for holding the ropes of Turkey started. Many commentators in Turkey label the recent fallout as a \"state crisis\" since the government is perceived to be intervening in the judiciary, and the principle of separation of powers does not seem to be as intact as it should in a democracy. On the other hand, Cemaat is not a transparent movement; no-one knows the extent of its financial power, how many millions of followers it has, how influential it is in key offices within Turkish state and what would happen if it gained further influence. Neither does anyone know who might win this full-scale battle: Mr Erdogan or Mr Gulen. Supporters of both sides accuse each other of undermining democracy and the rule of law; the media has become increasingly polarised with either pro-Erdogan or pro-Gulen voices leaving little space for others and the Turkish public increasingly feeling as if they are watching a fierce tennis match, holding their breaths. Recently, it was alleged that there could be detente between Mr Erdogan and Mr Gulen through a letter Mr Gulen sent to the president of the country. But that option does not seem to be on the table any more. Now there is speculation that there might soon be an investigation into Cemaat, with accusations it is a \"terrorist organisation\". On the other hand there is a possibility that people affiliated to Cemaat could leak new allegations involving influential people close to the government. With the local elections in two months time, a presidential election this summer and a general election next year; with Turkish lira falling to a record low against the dollar and the foreign investors watching events nervously, many people in Turkey fear the path ahead with bitter power struggles, may cause political and economic instability in the country.", "question": "Benjamin Harvey , Bloomberg 's Istanbul bureau chief , recently tweeted : \" Considering unfollowing Turkish politics completely on mental health @placeholder . \"", "option_0": "grounds", "option_1": "concerns", "option_2": "topics", "option_3": "advice", "option_4": "information", "label": 0}

{"article": "Australia's Channel Nine said reporter Tara Brown and three colleagues faced four charges, including kidnapping. Five people arrested alongside them - including the children's Australian mother - have also been charged. The mother, Sally Faulkner, says her estranged Lebanese husband moved the children to Lebanon without permission. Channel Nine said it had been \"seeking to highlight\" cross-border custody disputes. The Australian journalists and Ms Faulkner were detained by Lebanese police on Thursday along with two British employees of the UK-based company Child Abduction Recovery International (CARI), and two Lebanese men, officials said. On Tuesday, the official National News Agency reported that Mount Lebanon's Attorney General, Claude Karam, had filed charges, including participating in an abduction, against the nine suspects and referred to the case to an investigating magistrate. CCTV footage broadcast by Lebanese TV appears to show six-year-old Lahala and four-year-old Noah being bundled into a car by several men on a busy street in southern Beirut on Wednesday morning. They had been heading to school with a domestic worker and their paternal grandmother, who says she was knocked to the ground during the abduction. On Saturday, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told reporters that diplomats had been in touch with Lebanese officials and were providing consular assistance to Ms Faulkner and the TV crew. \"Given the sensitivities of this case and the fact children are involved, we are handling this very carefully,\" she said. Channel Nine has refused to say whether it paid CARI to recover the children for Ms Faulkner. However, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday cited Lebanese officials as saying they had a signed statement from a member of the \"recovery team\" saying the network had paid A$115,000 ($88,100; Â£61,600). Channel Nine said in a statement: \"It is extremely important to stress that we are severely limited in what we can say given that matters are now part of a legal process in Lebanon. We are co-operating fully with the Lebanese authorities and it is important to stress that we respect the laws of Lebanon and its judiciary. \"Regrettably a number of inaccurate media reports are exacerbating the concern and confusion of the families of those being detained.\" A Lebanese judicial official told the Associated Press news agency that the investigating magistrate would gather testimony from the suspects beginning on Tuesday. The magistrate would explore whether Ms Faulkner had custody of the children under Australian law, which might serve as a mitigating factor, the official said. The custody dispute between Ms Faulkner and her ex-husband, Ali Elamine, has reportedly been going on for several years. She says he took the children to Lebanon for a holiday last year but did not return. Mr Elamine told Lebanese media that Ms Faulkner and Australian security agencies knew he was leaving Australia with the children and denied kidnapping them. He also revealed that he did not plan to sue his former wife, explaining: \"She is the mother of my children... if I were her I would have done the same.\" Lebanon is not party to the Hague Convention, a treaty designed to ensure the swift return of children abducted internationally by a parent.", "question": "Prosecutors in Lebanon have filed charges against an Australian TV crew @placeholder over an attempt to abduct two children in a custody dispute .", "option_0": "erupted", "option_1": "comments", "option_2": "held", "option_3": "involved", "option_4": "renewed", "label": 2}

{"article": "Jocelerme Privert told the BBC that devastating losses from last month's Hurricane Matthew were equal to the country's entire national budget. Mr Privert said Haiti was facing a \"major food crisis\" and worsening levels of malnutrition. He urged governments around the world to do more to help. Hurricane Matthew ripped through Haiti on 4 October. The Category 4 storm, the strongest to hit the Caribbean in a decade, devastated large parts of the country and affected 2.1 million people. The Haitian government estimates 1.5 million people are in need of immediate assistance, including more than 140,000 people who are living in temporary shelters. Speaking from his home in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, Mr Privert said that he \"didn't want to see Haitian people die because of the unavailability of international assistance\". The president warned that without immediate financial support to replant crops destroyed by Hurricane Matthew, Haiti's situation could worsen further. \"If we don't manage to re-launch agriculture then in three to four months we'll find ourselves with a major food crisis,\" he told the BBC. \"Our projection is that we need between $25m (Â£20m) and $30m to resolve the farming issue.

{"article": "The New Democratic Party (NDP) ended the Progressive Conservatives' (PC) 44-year rule of the province. Political observers were stunned by the result, with one commentator saying: \"Pigs do fly\". Alberta's Premier Jim Prentice, a former member of Tory Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, said he was stepping down from political life. He only became premier in September, and called the snap election in April to seek a mandate after bringing in a tough tax-raising budget. \"My contribution to public life is now at an end,\" Mr Prentice said as he conceded defeat, blaming the collapse in oil prices and the subsequent financial problems. Alberta witnessed a political earthquake last night. The major oil producing province in Canada, it has been the country's major economic engine for several years. However, the precipitous drop in the price of oil created a $7bn hole in the province's finances. Prentice decided to base his campaign on a budget that increased taxes/fees (except for corporations), slightly cut government spending and ran a $5bn deficit. However, this budget angered many Albertans and they responded by electing Notley who campaigned on a very different vision. Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley called the surprising win \"a fresh start for our great province\". The result could be seen as a warning to Mr Harper, a Conservative, with a general election looming in October. \"I look forward to working with future Premier Notley on issues of importance for Albertans and all Canadians, including creating jobs, economic growth and long-term prosperity across the province and country,\" Mr Harper said in a statement on Wednesday. The NDP, which has never held more than 16 seats in the 87-seat legislature, looks set to win about 55 seats. The PCs got around 11, behind the newer and even more conservative Wildrose Party.

{"article": "Eamon Bradley, 28, from Melmore Gardens in Creggan is accused of receiving weapons training at a rebel camp in Syria in 2014. He was arrested after returning home later. On Wednesday, the jury at Londonderry Crown Court was read transcripts of his interviews with the police. He told police after training with a rebel faction called the Army of Islam he took part in three battles, two against government forces and one against ISIS near the city of Aleppo. But he said he never used his AK47 or grenade on the battlefield. He became disillusioned with the fighting and returned home. Earlier, the trial heard that Mr Bradley contacted people on social media to help him get into the country to join the rebellion. Mr Bradley, a Muslim convert, denies six charges, including attending a rebel training camp in Syria and receiving training in guns and grenades. The case is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland. Mr Bradley told police he got a bus from Derry to Dublin in February 2014 after meeting a contact on Facebook. He then flew to Istanbul and got a second internal flight to Adana, in southern Turkey, where he made contact with sympathizers through the mobile messaging service, WhatsApp. He told detectives he travelled near the Turkey/Syria border but he was warned to go no further because it was controlled by so-called ISIS. Mr Bradley said he stayed with a man in a nearby village who he believed had contacts with the Free Syrian Army. Asked why he was travelling to Syria and if he had any concerns, he told detectives: \"I just wanted to be among the people who were being bombed\". He added that he had no concerns because he \"trusted in Allah\". Mr Bradley said he spent about two months in the village before a group of men, who claimed to have been held captive by ISIS, helped him cross into Syria on a makeshift raft. He then joined a mountain training camp belonging to the group Jaysh al-Islam - the Army of Islam. Detectives were told that it was here that he learned to fire AK-47 rifles and Russian machine guns; he also received some instruction on the use of mortar bombs. Mr Bradley told police that he was the only western European at the camp and was on the bottom rung of the ladder when it came to the group's command structure.

{"article": "Fiona Anderson, 23, died shortly before the bodies of her daughter and two sons were found in Lowestoft in April. The children had been subject to a child protection plan since 2011. A serious case review found the deaths were \"completely unexpected\", but more decisive action could have helped. The report said agencies had \"allowed the [intervention] process to drift\". Independent consultant Ron Lock, who conducted the review, examined how public agencies worked with the family prior to the deaths. Social services and other agencies were alerted to Ms Anderson and her partner, Craig McLelland, because of concerns about their parenting abilities. They were in communication over a three-year period, with a 14-month gap in between, when concerns diminished. During that time, there were reports that Levina and her baby brother Addy had slept for 13 nights in a double pushchair while being fed only biscuits. The report concluded that, while procedures were followed, Suffolk County Council's children and young people's services (CYPS) was not decisive enough. Mr Lock found that attempts to engage with the family had failed, but there were no warning signs to suggest Levina, three, Addy, two, and 11-month-old Kyden were in immediate danger. Court proceedings to remove Levina had been initiated but were withdrawn following a legal challenge and insufficient evidence. However, the report states, the process led the relationship between the family and children's social care to become strained. \"Despite interventions by a number of practitioners, there was no success in effectively engaging the family in interventions by professionals\", Mr Lock found. \"This meant that overall the implementation of the child protection plans was significantly compromised.\" The report cited how Ms Anderson \"specifically avoided professional interventions\", distrusted social services and rebuffed support from nursery staff because \"she thought the children would be exposed to sexual abuse\". The report found that almost three years before the children's deaths, in June 2010, concerns had diminished sufficiently for formal involvement to cease. \"Clearly, if the children had been placed in care this could have avoided the tragic outcome,\" the report said. 2010 - Social services and other agencies begin working with Fiona Anderson and Craig McLelland over their parenting abilities Court proceedings to remove their only child, Levina, are withdrawn but the process puts a strain on social care's relationship with the family June 2010 - Concerns diminish, involvement ceases May 2011 - Levina and her baby brother Addy are found to have slept in a double pushchair for 13 nights and \"fed only biscuits\" August 2011 - Levina and Addy are made subject to child protection plans, under the category of neglect, with Kyden added to the plan at his birth in May 2012 15 April 2013 - The body of Fiona Anderson is found at the foot of a multi-storey car park in Lowestoft. The bodies of her three children are later found at their flat \"But there was never any guarantee that an application for a care order for the children would have been successful. \"It was nevertheless concerning that a clear decision was not made by CYPS in respect of the need for a legal intervention and instead allowed the process to drift in a most unconstructive way.\" Mr Lock stated there had been \"no known history of either the mother or the father intentionally causing physical harm to the children, or any self-harming episodes by the parents themselves\". \"In this respect, the deaths of the children and their mother were completely unexpected,\" he wrote. \"Psychological and psychiatric\" assessments of the mother were proposed and discussed with her, the report concluded, but \"were never achieved because of her reluctances\". It added: \"At the time of writing there has been no coroner's inquest, although current evidence would suggest that the mother took the lives of the children prior to taking her own life. \" The report identified 13 \"learning points\" aimed at preventing future repetitions in similar cases.

{"article": "Bananas were a staple then - for family consumption and as a mainstay of the local economy - and they still are today. But the 50,000 or so people who live in this hilly district of small trading centres and scattered homesteads have been part of a high-profile aid initiative over the past nine years. It is one of the locations across Africa chosen by the US economist Jeffrey Sachs to establish Millennium Villages - intended to be a model for accelerating the end of global poverty. The Millennium Villages concept has been backed by the United Nations, preparing a string of summits this year as the world marks a transition from the Millennium Development Goals to broader and more ambitious Sustainable Development Goals. The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, says the Millennium Villages are \"showcasing how effective an integrated strategy for education, health care, agriculture and small business can be\". It is when you reach the ridge where Ruhiira's main trading centre has developed that you get a sense of how the area is changing. Clustered around a crossroads, there are now several small grocery stores, shops selling medicines, hardware stores and eating places. There is a bar with a well-used billiards table on the veranda. There are shops where you can draw money with a mobile phone. And there is a co-operative bank with customers queuing up for loans but, for now, with all too little capital to meet the demand. There was scarcely any electricity in this area a few years ago. Then solar power started to make an appearance and now the grid is extending into the area too. A large water tank at the Ruhiira trading centre - fed by piped water - shows progress, too, in the critical area of providing more people with access to clean and safe water. Mr Sachs said that at the peak, the Ruhiira project was investing around $60 (£40) per person per year on health, education, water, sanitation, agriculture etc. (Source: Millennium Village project) Life in a town called Mongo The funding is due to drop down to zero by the end of this year. But Mr Sachs believes even modest resources, if very well directed, can make a \"huge\" difference. But the Ugandan government is stepping up its spending in the area, with the help of some funding from Islamic Development Bank and they are negotiating with other agencies. Some people say they have seen far-reaching change in their lives during the period of the Millennium Village project. Take Robert Nkunda, a 35-year-old farmer. He has been able to build a more substantial home and has wooden sheds for his livestock. In the fields around he grows maize, bananas, coffee and beans. But he could have felt that he had no future in this part of Uganda. \"My father died when I was still very young,\" he says. \"We didn't have enough land. Only a plot where we lived. \"That is the reason I didn't go far in education. But I worked hard to buy this land where I am farming.\" He hopes his children won't forget the land. In the past many children used to drop out of primary school - girls, in particular. Nyakamuri primary school packs 580 children into its single storey classrooms - one of which is now a solar-powered computer room. The head teacher, Florence Kakiiza, describes the everyday challenges her pupils face: \"Most of them have to walk long distances,\" she says. \"They don't have light to do homework and most don't have enough food at home. \"It is still a struggle but we are moving a bit on education… nearly every child is going to school.\" Ms Kakiiza says one of the biggest challenges in education now is to see more girls in impoverished rural areas like this going to - and staying in - secondary school. \"Most rural girls still drop out of secondary schools,\" she says. \"They get married when they are very young. They have many children from as early as 14.\" The Community Health Workers who now provide a \"front line\" of health care across the Millennium Village area include family planning in the advice they give to villagers as they do their rounds - on bicycles. But where they appear to have had most success is in helping in the effort to bring down once notoriously high levels of child and maternal mortality. They have modern technology on hand for this - carrying smartphones with a special app to feed in data when they visit a pregnant mother or a newborn infant. The Ugandan government has been investing about $8 per person in the health sector of the country, says David Siriri, a development expert working for the government. \"We came with a proposal that we invest at least $30... If the government mobilised its resources and prioritised it well that money can be got\". He said one thing already translated into policy at the national level is that the government is willing to pay more to doctors in rural, hard-to-reach areas. This helps to keep them working there, and is already happening and paying dividends in Ruhiira, he added. Critics of the Millennium Villages maintain they have achieved little in narrowing deeply rooted inequality, which is often exacerbated by the amount of land people have. Project officials argue that they are showing the way to reducing inequality - and that progress is as much about changing mindsets as it is about aid. The Millennium Voice radio station in Ruhiira airs villagers' concerns and offers advice and help. The Millennium Village projects have provoked much debate. They will clearly prove their value by whether their achievements are sustained and shared by everyone - and are taken up elsewhere.", "question": "As you climb up the winding reddish - @placeholder gravel road to Ruhiira - past endless dense plantations of matoke bananas - it can feel at first sight as if it is a world largely unchanged from when I was first working in Uganda close to 50 years ago .", "option_0": "sided", "option_1": "trained", "option_2": "based", "option_3": "coloured", "option_4": "launched", "label": 3}
{"article": "He was talking about the retailer's efforts to drive its stores upmarket and \"elevate its retail proposition\". The idea is to give more space over to branded goods and showcase their \"very best products\", even opening gyms in some of the flagship stores. And on Thursday it announced a \"strategic partnership\" with upmarket Japanese sportswear brand Asics, whose products will be stocked in Asics-managed areas of flagship stores from next year. Sports Direct described this as \"an important step in Sports Direct's journey to being recognised as the Selfridges of sport.'\" Well, there was only one way to find out what this was all about - take a visit to its flagship store on London's Oxford Street, which is showcasing the latest approach. As I walked through the door, to be greeted by thumping music,  I dredged through my memory for the last time I'd been in a Sports Direct. It was a long time ago, but my memory was of the slightly claustrophobic feel of fighting through a crowded jumble of kit and equipment, and my perception, right or wrong, that this was an environment aimed primarily at men. So the fact that the Oxford Street store felt light and airy with plenty of space between rails was a welcome relief. But let's be honest, I'm not a typical Sports Direct customer. Yes, I exercise regularly, but fashion is not foremost in my mind when I'm struggling through another tortuous workout, and I think of Sports Direct as being more about fashion than \"serious\" sport. Could I be converted? Well, first off, reinforcing my prejudice that this is more of a male environment, the first thing you see as you walk through the door of the Oxford Street store is a display of club strips and a sign proclaiming this is \"The Home of Football\",  a reminder that another of Sports Direct's stated aims is to become just that - the home of football. And most of the customers did seem to be male. Of course, a key element of shopping is how the staff treat you. Would I be made to feel welcome? As I wandered aimlessly, an assistant did offer to help me, so a big tick there. What would happen if I tried to buy something. New boxing gloves. Could I get an assistant to advise me? Yes, as it turned out. A smiley young woman confidently explained the point of the different glove weights. OK, once I'd said I would buy them she tried to sell me a special offer on some \"workout make up\" but was quite happy when I said I'd think about it. So how about trying to buy something for my sartorially conservative husband? On the floor below there was no price on the black T-shirt I chose. But another assistant spent a good few minutes checking out the price on the website. Ticks all round for my experience of the staff I came up against, anyway. So then I waylaid shoppers as they left the store to gauge their reactions. Rory Bryant, a teacher who used to work in advertising, had come into buy some socks. He had spotted the shift upmarket and was impressed by the lighter feel, \"compared to most Sports Direct stores\". \"Most are a jumble of crumpled socks and piles of clothing,\" he says. Photographers' agent James Denton, 49, had been in the Oxford Street store for the first time. He came out with a football for his two-year old son. He said he normally thought of the chain as a slightly downmarket depressing experience. \"so it definitely feels different\". \"Stuff is a lot better laid out, they've put a lot of thought into design and layout of everything,\" he added. Another customer, Philip Yardy, described the design of the shops as \"open, appealing\" and encouraging people to walk through. But Stuart Deveson wasn't quite so happy. He spent all of 10 seconds in there, he said. He agreed the entrance to the shop \"looks quite nice\", but said the reason he had walked out so quickly was because he'd gone in to buy shorts and couldn't find them. \"If they're not going to make it easy to find what I want, I'll go somewhere else,\" he said. Sports Direct now has more than 25 new generation stores, of which 12 are \"flagship\" outlets. It plans to open between 16 and 24 new stores in the current financial year, of which about half will be flagship stores. So is Sports Direct \"smashing it out of the park\" with its \"Selfridges of Sport\" concept? Financial analysts seem happy enough with how it's going. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a \"transformational\" year for Sports Direct. Progress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were \"a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores\". Initial impressions from the shoppers I spoke to at least do seem positive. Perhaps the last word should go to customer Rory Bryant, who compared the Oxford Street flagship with another retail success story. He said it was now \"more like Niketown up the road\", and perhaps that, as much as Selfridges, is the inspiration behind the chain's makeover.", "question": "\" It 's clear we have smashed the ball out of the park with our ' Selfridges ' of sport concept , \" boasted Sports Direct chief executive Mike Ashley to financial analysts , following the release of the company 's latest @placeholder .", "option_0": "acquisition", "option_1": "body", "option_2": "media", "option_3": "results", "option_4": "team", "label": 3}
{"article": "There's a growing realisation that offshore decommissioning is now really happening. Over the next 25 years or so, the process of retiring North Sea oil and gas facilities could cost tens of billions of pounds, according to projections. But while that is a cost for the operators of the more than 600 oil and gas installations in the North Sea it is an opportunity for firms which can develop the safest and most cost-effective ways forward. It could also mean hundreds of new jobs requiring a new kind of expertise in the coming decades. A major industry event - Decom Offshore 2015 - has been running at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre. The event is run by Decom North Sea (DNS), which was created in 2009, the representative body for the offshore decommissioning industry. DNS chairman Callum Falconer said: \"We are cutting our teeth. There's a sudden realisation that decommissioning is upon us. \"Decommissioning used to be seen as the beginning of the end. Now it's seen as the beginning.\" \"One challenge is that we have to make sure the workforce comes together. \"There's an opportunity for young graduates and engineers to carve out a career in decommissioning.\" Mr Falconer highlighted work that is under way on a new decommissioning learning portal for the industry, to share ideas, which he predicted would be a \"game changer\". One of the major decommissioning plans already in the pipeline is for the iconic Brent field, off Shetland, which operated by Royal Dutch Shell. The oil field lends its name to the benchmark for setting oil prices in the North Sea - Brent Crude. Shell has four platforms in the field but only one of them, Brent Charlie, still produces oil. DNS chief executive Nigel Jenkins outlined five key areas of decommissioning focus - driving collaboration, efficiency, getting the supply chain ready, innovation, and delivering benefits. Mr Jenkins said: \"Collaboration is key due to the interconnected nature of the industry, and the need to share knowledge. \"Decommissioning on this scale has not happened before. \"Particularly for this region, for Aberdeen, we need to make this area is a centre of excellence, a place where the right sort of expertise is available.\" He explained there had been about 10 major decommissioning projects in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) over the past 20 years, and there was now set to be a \"ramp up\" in such activity. He said it was difficult to predict potential job numbers, but highlighted that Shell's Brent decommissioning project has hundreds of people working on it. Mr Jenkins said: \"There are so many influences over when a project will happen, including age, oil left in a field, and the price of oil. \"That equation is different for every operator.\" He said: \"This conference has shown what a great pool of talent there is to address the challenges. There is a positive feeling. \"We're at the beginning of the market. We are at a point of seismic change.\" Shell's current work is not the first decommissioning project from the Brent field. Twenty years ago, the Brent Spar got international coverage over Shell plans to dump the oil storage module in the deep waters of the North Atlantic. Protesters from Greenpeace occupied it for several days in 1995 and Shell was forced to alter its plans. Brent Spar was instead towed to Norway and moored in a fjord, before being broken up. Although the first stage of this fresh wave of plans - using a giant ship to remove the top of platforms in a single lift - is unlikely to prompt controversy on that scale, there is little doubt the second phase will be the subject of closer scrutiny. This involves contaminated concrete oil storage tanks, which sit on the seabed next to the platform's legs. This challenging new chapter in the North Sea story is well and truly under way.", "question": "As a growing number of North Sea oil and gas fields head towards the end of their production lives , industry leaders are waking up to the challenges - and opportunities - that lie ahead .

{"article": "Using animals as a source of organs for transplantation into humans was once one of medicine's next big things - a solution to transplant waiting lists. However, there have been problems with rejection - and recently stem cells have been grabbing the spotlight. But some researchers are now saying that transplants from animals \"could soon become a reality\", but not necessarily as originally expected. There is still a pressing need for organs. In the UK there are 8,000 people on the waiting list - three die every day. Several technologies are trying to meet the demand. In August, a patient from London was the first in the UK to have his heart replaced with a mechanical one while stem cells have been used for simple structures such as the windpipe. However, using stem cells to build more complicated organs such as a heart is a long way off and mechanical body parts are used in the short term before an actual transplant. Using animals as a source - known as \"xenotransplantation\" - is another potential solution. Pigs have been used as a source of heart valves, which control the flow of blood around the heart. Here the pig cells are chemically stripped away and when the remaining structure is transplanted, human cells grow around it. Stripping away the living material would not work for most transplants - nobody would want the heart that did not beat. However, that living material has a big problem, namely rejection. The human immune system attacks the pig tissue, which it recognises as foreign. Dr David Cooper from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre is one of a group of researchers arguing in the Lancet that the problems with organ rejection are being overcome. Some pigs - GTKO pigs - have been genetically modified. They no longer produce a pig protein, galactosyltransferase, which the immune system would have attacked. The authors say that this kind of rejection is \"not the main cause of graft failure\", however, \"other issues have become more prominent\". Problems such as damaging blood clots and inflammation will require further genetic modification. As a result they say that: \"Overall, clinical pig organ xenotransplantation will probably not be undertaken in the next few years.\" While therapies are distant on the whole organ level, they believe researchers are getting closer to transplanting small numbers of cells. In patients with type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks islet cells in the pancreas, which control sugar levels. Transplanting organs from animals fit uncomfortably into medicine. They are not the present, but neither are they necessarily the future. At the moment the best treatment for organ failure is generally a human organ transplant. With a shortage of available organs and long waiting lists in many countries, there is a need for another solution. Yet animal organs do not have a proven safety and effectiveness record so cannot meet the demand. In the very distant future, the attention is likely to move away from transplanting and towards growing your own. Doctors would like to use personalised stem cells to make replacement organs, which would match the body's tissue and have no chance of rejection. Animal organs would struggle to compete with that. What happens between now and then is still up for grabs. Animal organs do have considerable potential, but only if they can be proved safe, effective and if nothing better comes along first. Most people can manage the condition with insulin, but some have therapy to replace the lost cells. Around one in 500 patients with type 1 diabetes have unpredictable low sugar levels and only those are currently suitable for the treatment. However, in the UK there is a waiting time of up to 18 months and the number of cells which can be transplanted to each patient is limited. The authors argue that using pigs as a source for these cells is \"much more encouraging\", than using whole organ transplants. They write: \"Because pig insulin was given to patients with diabetes for decades, and because a diabetic monkey survived for more than one year supported only by pig islets, clinical pig-islet xenotransplantation will almost certainly be physiologically successful.\" Clinical trials are underway in New Zealand to test that theory. Dr Martin Rutter, senior lecturer at the University of Manchester, said he was \"interested, but cautious\". He warned that: \"It is still not clear whether it is an effective treatment or a safe treatment. \"If it proves safe and effective it could be an amazing development.\" It has also been suggested that some cells in the brain could be transplanted to ease neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or that pigs could be a source of corneas. \"With regard to pig tissues and cells, as opposed to organs, it would seem that clinical xenotransplantation could soon become a reality,\" the researchers conclude. NHS Blood and Transplant said organs from animals had huge potential for the future to fill the gap between availability and demand, but there were \"many complex issues still to overcome\" and that there was \"still a long way to go\". It says until then, getting more people to donate organs would be the most successful strategy.", "question": "Are pigs about to @placeholder from the dinner table to the operating table ?", "option_0": "offer", "option_1": "migrate", "option_2": "retire", "option_3": "receive", "option_4": "go", "label": 1}

{"article": "It said such policies offer \"poor value for money\". \"Firms must start putting consumers first, and stop seeing them as pound signs,\" said Christopher Woolard, director of policy at the FCA. The insurance industry rejected the accusations, calling some of them unhelpful. Add-on insurance is where a policy is sold alongside another product. For example, customers buying a mobile phone, or a holiday, are often offered insurance at the same time. Nearly 3,000 consumers have complained about such policies in the past nine months. The FCA found that a quarter of customers buying them were unaware that they could get similar products elsewhere. And more than half of such customers did not compare the different policies available. The FCA judged add-on policies by their \"claims ratio\". This measures the proportion of the initial cost of a product that is eventually paid out under the policy. In the case of add-on personal accident insurance it found that the claims ratio was just 9%. In the case of Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) policies - often sold with cars - it found that just 10% of the full value was returned to claimants. In comparison, regular household or motor insurance policies paid out 64% of the original purchase price. As a result, the FCA said many consumers may be paying for policies which are poor value. But the industry said the claims ratio was not a good way of measuring performance. \"The emphasis upon claims ratios is unhelpful; they are not an accurate benchmark of customer value, not least because they are affected by distribution costs for the insurer,\" said Hugh Savill, the director of regulation at the Association of British Insurers.

Six men deny conducting themselves in a \"violent, riotous and tumultuous\" manner and forming a mob of \"evilly disposed persons\". The incident at the jail is alleged to have happened in May 2014. On trial are Robert Gill, 26, from Newburgh in Aberdeenshire, Stephen Sim, 31, from Stonehaven, Michael Stewart, 31, from Forfar, 30-year-old Dominic Jordan, from Wirral in Merseyside, Sandy Mundie, 30, from Aberdeen, and 33-year-old George Thomson, also from Aberdeen. They are said to have acted aggressively with their faces masked while brandishing sticks and metal poles. The men are said to have culpable and recklessly thrown the objects from a height with no consideration of the consequences of where the objects would land or whether they would strike anyone. Prison officer Jordan Hodge told Aberdeen Sheriff Court that before the alleged riot there had been \"general unrest\" after some prisoners were placed in isolation following a disturbance. He said other inmates were aware of the situation and they believed the prisoners had been unfairly treated. Mr Hodge said he returned to work the following day and initially did not note anything unusual about the mood of the prisoners. But he told the jury that there was \"quite a lot of hilarity\" when he entered the C Section at the jail during the recreational period that night. Fiscal depute David Bernard asked: \"I understand you noticed a smell of hooch or homemade alcohol?\" Mr Hodge replied: \"Yes, I did.\" Mr Bernard asked: \"Homemade alcohol or hooch, is that something prisoners are permitted to have?\" Mr Hodge replied: \"No.\" The prison officer said he noticed that inmates had congregated in the left-hand side of the unit and there was music playing.

{"article": "Edward Snowden, 29, checked out from his hotel on Monday and his whereabouts are unknown, but he is believed to be still in Hong Kong. Earlier, he said he had an \"obligation to help free people from oppression\". His leaks led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data. The programme, known as Prism, is run by the US National Security Agency (NSA). The Office of the Director of National Intelligence gave details of the programme last week after Mr Snowden's leaks led to a series of articles in the Guardian and Washington Post newspapers. According to the office's statement, Prism is simply an internal computer system, and not a data-mining programme. Profile: Edward SnowdenCould Hong Kong shelter Snowden?Q&A: Prism and privacy However, such data seizures could break the laws of other countries, and could also break US law if they accidentally capture communications of US citizens. Hong Kong's broadcaster RTHK said Mr Snowden checked out of the Mira hotel in Kowloon on Monday, and Reuters news agency quoted hotel staff as saying that he had left at noon. Ewen MacAskill, one of the Guardian journalists who broke the story, told the BBC he believed Mr Snowden was still in Hong Kong. It is believed the US is pursuing a criminal investigation, but no extradition request has yet been filed. The Chinese territory has an extradition treaty with the US, although analysts say any attempts to bring Mr Snowden to America may take months and could be blocked by Beijing. A petition posted on the White House website calling for Mr Snowden's immediate pardon has gathered more than 30,000 signatures. World media fume However, an opinion poll commissioned by the Washington Post suggests a majority of Americans think government monitoring of phone records is acceptable if the aim is to fight terrorism. Mr Snowden's revelations have led to allegations that the UK's electronic surveillance agency, GCHQ, used the US system to spy on British citizens. Foreign Secretary William Hague cancelled a trip to Washington to address the UK parliament on Monday and deny the claims. The journalists involved in the story were first contacted by Mr Snowden at the start of the year. Filmmaker Laura Poitras told Salon Magazine how Mr Snowden sent her an email saying: \"I want to get your encryption key and let's get on a secure channel. \"I have some information in the intelligence community, and it won't be a waste of your time.\" Ms Poitras ultimately filmed the interview with two Guardian reporters. Mr Snowden told the journalists: \"The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything. With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting. \"I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things. I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.\" Booz Allen Hamilton confirmed in a statement Mr Snowden had been an employee for less than three months. US leaks that shook the world What can you learn from phone records? Just how much do the spooks know? \"If accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,\" the statement said. The first of the leaks came out on Wednesday night, when the Guardian reported a US secret court had ordered phone company Verizon to hand over to the NSA millions of records on telephone call \"metadata\". The metadata include the numbers of both phones on a call, its duration, time, date and location (for mobiles, determined by which mobile signal towers relayed the call or text). Under the Prism system, officials apply to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court (Fisa) to gain access to communications. Officials are obliged to show the Fisa court that any \"target\" is outside of the US, and there is a \"foreign intelligence purpose\" for the seizure, such as terrorism or nuclear proliferation. However, details of such targets and subsequent requests made to US technology companies are secret. On Thursday, the Washington Post and Guardian said the NSA tapped directly into the servers of nine internet firms including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo to track online communication in a programme known as Prism. All the internet companies denied giving the US government \"direct access\" to their servers, and said they had never heard of the Prism programme. But in separate statements the firms variously said they complied with lawful requests to supply information on an individual basis. Prism was authorised under changes to US surveillance laws passed under President George W Bush, and renewed last year under Barack Obama.

{"article": "Standing next to his wife, Jani, at a press conference at the Idaho National Guard headquarters, Robert Bergdahl looked like a tribal elder - or as close as one can find in Boise. He wore a beaded necklace and had a long beard. It was trimmed in a style that is popular among Haqqani militants, a group who had reportedly held his son captive in Pakistan near the Afghanistan border. While his wife, Jani, spoke at the podium about their son, he tugged at his beard and fought back tears. \"I'm proud of how much you wanted to help the Afghan people,\" Bergdahl said, addressing his son directly. He told the journalists in the room that central Idaho looks like Afghanistan, since both places have rugged mountains and harsh terrain. The land is beautiful and \"heart-breaking\", he said. \"It makes you tough.\" For years his own toughness has been tested, as he watched Taliban-produced videos of his son. Then on Saturday, Bergdahl heard the good news directly from US President Barack Obama - his son was free. Kidnappings have become a distressingly common occurrence over the past several decades, used by militants to raise cash or to send a political message. Family members usually stay behind the scenes and hope that government officials, special forces or hired experts will help their loved ones. \"Families are told to keep things quiet because you don't want to upset the process,\" says Marvin Weinbaum, a former Pakistan analyst for the US State Department. The kidnapping and release of Sgt Bergdahl has been marked by controversy, however, and by his father's forthright approach to the ordeal. According to media accounts, Sgt Bergdahl left his military outpost in Afghanistan in June 2009 and then was seized by Taliban militants. Some call him a deserter.  At this point, the full story of his kidnapping is not known. Years ago, a military official told me that he and others were trying hard to get Bergdahl released, but that they could only go so far in their efforts. \"The US does not negotiate with kidnappers,\" he explained. In fact, US officials were trying in private to hammer out a deal with the Taliban. Negotiations over Bergdahl went on for years, leading to an exchange - him for five Taliban detainees held at Guantanamo, a decision that has led to criticism from Republicans. Source: James JF Forest's Global Trends in Kidnapping Even when kept under wraps, the discussions were delicate. Yet the father did not stay quiet. He spoke frequently with US officials - and with the Taliban, though indirectly. In a video released on YouTube in May 2011, he was shown in front of a mountain, thanking the Haqqanis and others \"who have cared for our son\". It was part of a bold, and sometimes bizarre, strategy to get his son back. \"This man didn't play by the usual rules,\" says Mr Weinbaum. \"Whether or not that actually brought about his son's release, you can't know for sure,\" he says. \"But it certainly kept the sergeant at the forefront.\" Robert Bergdahl hardly fits the profile of a high-stakes negotiator. He is an unusual man even by mountain standards, a culture that celebrates those who live \"off the grid\". He lives at the end of a dirt road in Hailey (population 7,000), in a house crammed with books. For years he worked as a deliveryman for United Parcel Service. \"He is personable,\" says his friend Sue Martin,  owner of Zaney's River Street Coffee House. Years ago she hired his son to make lattes. A photo of Sgt Bowe, clean-faced and serious in his army beret, now sits on the counter next to a jar of biscotti and a Magic 8 Ball, a toy that makes predictions. She says customers would pick up the Magic 8 Ball and all ask the same question. \"It was always, 'When is Bowe coming home?', not, 'Is he?\"' she says. \"There's not been a doubt expressed.\" Today the town is filled with yellow balloons and signs that say \"Bowe Is Free at Last\". People here rallied behind Robert Bergdahl, even when he said provocative things. After his son was seized, Bergdahl dove into a study of Pashto and the politics of the militants. Last month he sent out a tweet directed to a Taliban leader saying he was \"working to free all Guantanamo prisoners\". He added: \"God will repay for the death of every Afghan child.\" His friends have tried to empathise. \"He's a dad,\" says Lance Stephensen, a member of a group called Boise Valley POW-MIA Corporation. Their motorcycles were parked outside the Idaho National Guard headquarters on Sunday. \"Think of the pressure and stress.\" At the press conference Robert Bergdahl hinted at some of the struggles that he and others faced while they tried to get his son released. \"You'll never know how complicated this was,\" he said at the press conference. Whether mistaken or not, Robert Bergdahl's rogue campaign ended well. He told journalists that his son would soon go from Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany to an army medical centre in Texas to help him adjust to the US.

{"article": "This pointer takes the form of a nickel signature in the rocks of the crater that is now buried under ocean sediments in the Gulf of Mexico. An international team has just drilled into the 200km-wide depression. It hopes the investigation can help explain why the event 66 million years ago was so catastrophic. Seventy-five percent of all life, not just the dinosaurs, went extinct. The UK-US led team gave an update on its research here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The group is currently running all manner of lab tests on the hundreds of metres of core pulled up from under the Gulf in April and May. One tantalising revelation is that the scientists observe a big nickel spike in the sediments immediately above what has become known as Chicxulub Crater. This is an important marker that could lead on to the discovery of asteroid material itself. The presumed 15km-wide space object would have been vaporised in the impact. But some portion of it would have condensed into small spherules in the sky to then rain back down on the bowl. It should be stressed that the nickel is not in itself an identification of asteroid material. To have real confidence, the scientists would prefer to see the element iridium. This is extremely rare on Earth but is frequently associated with meteorites. Iridium is apparent in the geological layers around the globe that mark the dinosaur-killing event at the end of the Cretaceous Period, but to find it in the actual crater would be an exciting observation. It could result in further insights on the nature of the asteroid that smashed into Earth. One theory is that its metals could have made the environment toxic for many lifeforms. Four labs are currently testing for the presence of iridium. Prof Philippe Claeys from the Free University in Brussels says finding the Nickel is a very good sign. \"Nickel behaves chemically in a way that is very similar to iridium; it loves to make strong chemical bonds with iron, just like iridium,\" he told BBC News. \"So we treat nickel as what we call a proxy for an elevated concentration of iridium. If we see high nickel, it's very likely that we're going to have high iridium.\" Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Rock was recovered from more than 1,300m below the modern seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico. What has thrilled the team is the quality and abundance of material now in the labs. \"Why this is a jackpot core is because we have an expanded section. We have an amount of material that turns into a resolution that allows us to ask lots of questions,\" said Prof Sean Gulick, the co-chief scientist from the University of Texas at Austin, US. \"For example, if we do see iridium especially in dust, it's not just a tracer for the impactor, it could also tell us something about when this material left the atmosphere and things (the likely dark sky conditions following the impact) started clearing up.\" Prof Tim Bralower from Pennsylvania State University is studying the core rocks for the fossils of tiny organisms that lived in the seawater above the crater - from the immediate aftermath of the impact to millions of years hence. What sort of species are present and how they change up through the sediments should tell him something about how long it took for \"normal conditions\" to return. \"It's unusual to see such a beautiful record of recovery in this exact location where the mass extinction originated.

{"article": "It refers to the amount the Pentagon spends on erectile dysfunction medication annually: about $84m (Â£63m), according to the Military Times newspaper. In contrast, the Rand Corporation think tank estimated last year that gender transition-related health care costs for transgender personnel would increase the military's active duty health budget by $8.4m per year at the most. But why does the US defence department spend so much on erectile dysfunction drugs? First, it is worth pointing out that the Military Times' February 2015 report based its figure on 2014 data from the Defense Health Agency. The spend of $84.2m was for that year, but the newspaper also reported that $294m had been spent on Viagra, Cialis and other such medications since 2011. It pointed out that this cost the equivalent of more than a few fighter jets. In 2014, some 1.18 million prescriptions were filled, mostly for Viagra. But who were they for? The answer goes some way in explaining the massive spend. It is true that some of the erectile dysfunction medication went to active-duty personnel. But the vast majority went to other groups eligible, including millions of military retirees and their family members. In fact, around 10 million people in total are estimated to be covered by the Pentagon's healthcare system, which cost $52bn in 2012. It is well known that erectile dysfunction is more common among older men - which would explain a hefty bill for retired service members. In fact, less than 10% of the prescriptions were for active duty personnel, according to the Military Times. Still, erectile dysfunction among those currently serving in the US military has been increasing since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began. A 2014 study by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) found that 100,248 cases of erectile dysfunction were diagnosed among active service members between 2004 and 2013, with \"annual incidence rates\" more than doubling in that time period. Nearly half of all the cases were due to psychological causes, according to the study. A study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2015 found that male veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were \"significantly more likely than their civilian counterparts to report erectile dysfunction or other sexual problems\", according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs. One study cited found that 85% of male combat veterans with PTSD report erectile dysfunction, nearly four times the rate among those returning from combat who are not diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In 2008, the Rand Corporation reported that one in five US veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were suffering from PTSD or major depression. However, a key statistic buried in the AFHSB study of active duty personnel between 2004 and 2013 suggests one should be cautious of reading too much into the links between America's recent wars, PTSD and erectile dysfunction in relation to the military's massive spend on Viagra. Personnel who had never been deployed were actually more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than their counterparts who had been. Finally, erectile dysfunction is linked to common conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. In 2007, it was estimated that the prevalence of erectile dysfunction among US men was 18%. In summary: it is a common condition, and the US military pays for the healthcare of millions of men, meaning it spends a lot on Viagra and other such drugs.", "question": "Amid the fall - out from US President Donald Trump 's announcement on Twitter that transgender people will not be able to serve in the US military , one statistic has been frequently @placeholder to draw attention to the comparatively small estimated costs of transgender healthcare .", "option_0": "urged", "option_1": "applied", "option_2": "held", "option_3": "struggling", "option_4": "raised", "label": 4}
{"article": "Part of the area at Llanberis in Gwynedd was home to a former RAF ammunitions store that was cleared in the 1970s. A report for the developers suggests some unexploded munitions could remain buried in the former quarry. But it said German nerve gas was removed and destroyed decades ago. The power company Snowdonia Pump Hydro (SPH) want to use the old Glyn Rhonwy quarry as the site of a 600 MWh pumped electricity storage facility. Those proposals are now being considered by the UK's Planning Inspectorate. However, opponents of the scheme in the area have concerns over possible contamination at the Glyn Rhonwy workings. The slate quarry was used as a secret munitions store during WW2, and later it was used to dispose of old and surplus bombs, bullets and grenades. Thousands of tonnes of weapons ended up in quarry pits there, prompting a massive RAF clean-up operation that only ended in the mid-1970s. The 'Concerned about Glyn Rhonwy' group said they believed that chemical weapons may have also been dumped or buried at the site.. A consultant's report confirmed that 70,000 German tabun nerve gas shells seized following WW2 were held at the Llanberis quarry for a short time. They were later moved to another facility near Caernarfon, and eventually dumped at sea. SPH commissioned consultants Zetica to examine issues surrounding unexploded munitions at the site, as part of the planning process. \"Nobody takes this issue lightly,\" stressed a spokesman for the hydro power company. \"We rely on the information in the Zetica report. It confirms that the German tabun bombs were held for a short time in a secure area at Glyn Rhonwy. There is no evidence that they were stored in any other area.\" The consultants stated that an official UK board of inquiry in the 1960s found \"all German chemical weapons appeared to have been successfully removed from RAF Llanberis\". But the Glyn Rhonwy campaigners have insisted that there can be no guarantees that every single tabun shell was removed. \"We think there is at least one discarded tabun bomb on the site,\" said Jeff Taylor, from the campaign group. He said that was based on documents uncovered in an archive relating to the quarry, which showed images of tabun bombs in Germany, and what appears to be the case of a similar bomb lying in a slate rock crevice. \"It is circumstantial evidence, but it is pretty damaging circumstantial evidence,\" argued Mr Taylor. Chemist Dr Dave Peskett, who has carried out research on the issue for the campaign group, said he had seen documents suggesting discarded mustard gas shells had also been dumped at the quarry in the past. The allegation is also disputed. But Dr Peskett added: \"It is not just the munitions that are the issue here. There's a huge pile of toxic residue there. \"Someone has to come in and remediate that site before any development takes place.\" The spokesman for SPH said tests had been carried out on water samples in the quarry in both 2012 and 2015, and no contamination was found. They added that \"in the unlikely event\" that unexploded ordnance was uncovered at Glyn Rhonwy, it would be dealt with in a \"rigorous\" process. \"It will ensure the safety of the people and the environment,\" said the official. BBC Wales has asked the Ministry of Defence to respond to concerns surrounding the site. However, a freedom of information request for details regarding the German nerve gas at Llanberis by the Concerned group was rejected stating that \"release of the information would enable ill-disposed persons or organisations to act against the national interest, and that therefore on balance the information should be withheld\".", "question": "Campaigners @placeholder to a planned hydro-electric pumping station in Snowdonia say the site could be contaminated by World War Two nerve gas .", "option_0": "opposed", "option_1": "according", "option_2": "belonging", "option_3": "eased", "option_4": "clinging", "label": 0}
{"article": "But as he plots to add a Test victory over the Lions to his unparalleled CV, Williams remains \"humble as hell and one of the bros,\" according to his team-mates. On Wednesday, Williams lines up for the Blues against the British and Irish Lions, as the Auckland-based franchise look to launch a pre-emptive strike before the Test series. For Williams, a devout Muslim, the game comes in the middle of Ramadan, with the 31-year-old fasting for up to 10 hours a day. \"We're lucky that we only fast for nine to 10 hours in this part of the world because of the daylight,\" says the 33-times capped All Black. \"I find the fasting easiest with footy-based training, and I just push back the weights until I break the fast. The first week of fasting is the toughest and then after that you start to get used to it.\" Speaking to Williams and a number of his team-mates and friends, it is clear his religion underpins his character. The New Zealand Rugby Union recently allowed a \"conscientious objection\" to Williams wearing certain sponsors logos, as he objects to the marketing of banks, alcohol and gambling companies because of his beliefs. \"He's really religious and he sticks by it. We support him wholeheartedly, and his choices off the field,\" says Blues number eight Steven Luatua, who is on his way to Bristol next season. \"The way he stands up for his convictions and what he believes in, a lot of us could learn from that, and a lot of us feed off him. \"I do believe religion really helps with the rigour and discipline of succeeding in sport. For a lot of us from religious backgrounds, we've got to this point because of our faith, because of our beliefs. \"So for him to display that on an international stage, to display who he is, not change for anyone, I think that's all credit to him.\" Williams' dedication and commitment to his craft - whatever it may be - is a recurring theme, but his faith enables him to keep a balanced perspective on life, according to Blues wing Matt Duffie. \"At times rugby players can get quite caught up in the rugby fishbowl,\" says Duffie. \"But his experience, faith and family means he can keep things in perspective. That doesn't take away the fact he is out there trying to win everything, because he's very competitive, but [keeping perspective] is one of his great qualities.\" However, Williams remains the ultimate competitor, and after his Rio Olympics Sevens experience ended in long-term injury, he is on his way back to top form and fitness, and in the frame to start in the centres against the Lions come the Test series. \"The one-percenters are eye-opening,\" says Blues full-back Michael Collins. \"The way he looks after his body and does his prep and his homework, he's pretty diligent in all he does.\" \"Off the field he's real professional and the boys feed off that,\" says Luatua. \"At the same time he's approachable and easy to talk to, and I think that's made his transitions between clubs and sports real easy. All round he's just a good dude.\" His head coach Tana Umaga will testify to that, after Williams moved to defuse news conference talk of the infamous spear tackle that ended Brian O'Driscoll's tour the last time the Lions were in New Zealand in 2005. But, as prop Charlie Faumuina, explains, Williams has a mischievous side. This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser \"He's a bit of a trouble maker,\" Faumuina says. \"We've got a thing where if you lose things they get auctioned off, but Sonny Bill tries to steal things to get them auctioned off.

I just left them there to get a drink of water and I came back and they were gone.\" Faumuina is one of eight New Zealand internationals in the Blues starting XV on Wednesday evening, but all eyes will be on Williams. It's something his team-mates are used to, but don't begrudge. \"Around here it's all about Sonny,\" adds another of the All Blacks, scrum-half Augustine Pulu. \"But he's a good man, bro.

{"article": "For Senegal it was a tale of double disappointment having lost the 2015 final on home soil against Nigeria. There had been fears that Zambia, who had looked impressive all tournament, may crack under the weight of expectation but the junior Chipolopolo held their cool to go into the break leading 2-0. Senegalese goalkeeper Lamine Sarr made two horrendous errors that a merciless Zambian frontline punished him for. The two sides had been sizing each other up in the opening minutes with Senegal having the first sight of goal when Ibrahima Niane's tame shot was easily picked up by Mangani Banda in the seventh minute. Zambia roared to life in the 14th minute when Fashion Sakala controlled the ball in the box but his ferociously struck shot went wide. Three minutes later Sakala was back on the by-line to tease the ball into the box with Sarr spilling it into the path of a grateful Patson Daka (pictured) whose predatory instincts came to life, toeing home. Senegal were not deterred and continued to pressure the Zambians with Niane forcing Shemmy Mayembe to trip him in the 28th minute, but the Senegalese fluffed the resulting set piece. Zambia were back on the attack when Sarr misjudged the ball, gifting an on-rushing Edward Chilufya a glorious opportunity for the hosts' second goal in the 35th minute. Senegal came pushing in the second half with second half substitute Ibrahima Ndiaye booked for throwing a suspicious substance into the Zambian goal. Referee Thierry Nkurunzinza yellow carded Ndiaye as tempers flared with the crowd booing Senegal. That spurred on Senegal with Aliou Badji almost getting a breakthrough but his powerfully struck effort in the 67th minute went wide. The match was turning into a battle between Zambia's keeper Mangani Banda and the Senegalese duo of Ndiaye and Badji. Banda was duly named man-of-the-match for his game-saving heroics between the sticks. In the earlier match Guinea came from behind to beat South Africa 2-1 and earn bronze.

{"article": "Seven prospective Scotland team members exceeded the Commonwealth Games standard over the weekend. Hayley Haining, Derek Hawkins and Susan Partridge starred in London's marathon. James McLachlan and Jade Nimmo excelled in long jump events, while hammer thrower Mark Dry and 800m specialist Lynsey Sharp gave notice of their form. Haining, now 41, ran two hours, 36 minutes and 52 seconds in London and could yet become Scotland's oldest ever female athlete at a Commonwealth Games. Hawkins was the top British runner in the elite men's race. He ran 2:16:50 in only his second marathon. Maybe what happened in the countdown to London will happen in the run-up to Glasgow - and the home Games factor has an effect Partridge, from Oban, came ninth in a time of 2:30:46, which is a good enough time for a place at the World Championships in Moscow in August. \"I am thrilled with ninth place. The best I have managed before at this kind of level is 17th so to be in the top 10 in the London Marathon feels special,\" she told scottishathletics. 'I was always very hopeful about the Glasgow 2014 standard, which is at 2:40:00, and hopefully I am pretty secure for that now.\" At the Mount Sac Relays in Walnut, California, McLachlan produced the second best long jump in Scottish athletics history and Dry gave the third-best hammer throw of his career. McLachlan's 7.86m pushed him into second place in the Scottish all-time list for the long jump behind record-holder Darren Ritchie and was well clear of the 7.60m that is the Glasgow 2014 standard. Dry, meanwhile, finished third in the elite hammer competition in California, with his best throw of 74.46m a long way beyond the 65m asked for the Glasgow games. And Sharp ran inside the required time in her first 800m run of the season. At Walnut her time of 2:02:63 landed her sixth place and was inside the Commonwealth Games standard of 2:02:80. She tweeted: 'Happy with my opener and great to be back in competition again.' Finally, in Florida, Nimmo leapt 6.31m to get inside the long jump standard of 6.20m. \"Maybe what happened in the countdown to London will happen in the run-up to Glasgow - and the home Games factor has an effect,' said Partridge. \"You are going to get people coming out of the woodwork, in a manner of speaking, and trying to come up with a performance which wins them a Scottish vest for a Commonwealth Games in Scotland. \"We cannot possibly say Hayley Haining has 'come out of the woodwork' because she has been around for a number of years and has been such a good athlete.
