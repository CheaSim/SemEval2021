The three-day event at Hazeltine National in Minnesota begins with the alternate shot foursomes and four fourball matches will follow, with the pairings to be announced on Friday. Saturday sees the foursomes and fourballs reversed before the contest is decided with all 12 players going head-to-head in singles matches. Englishman Rose and Stenson of Sweden, who won gold and silver respectively at the Rio Olympics in August, claimed three points as a pair two years ago, including their opening fourball match to set Europe on the way to a 16\u00bd-11\u00bd victory.

The idea of a \"five star rating system\" for individuals has also been dropped. This will take the form of \"recommendations\" instead. Co-founder Julia Cordray told the BBC that users of the app will also be able to control which recommendations appear on their profiles. However, in April a premium service called The Truth License will enable those who choose the upgrade to see everything that has been said about other members, whether they have chosen to share those comments or not.

The announcement follows the findings of an independent review of the child protection system, led by former Crown Office chief Catherine Dyer, and the government's child protection improvement programme report. Ms Dyer's report concluded that the child protection system \"works well\" for young people identified as being at risk, and is \"capable of delivering the support needed\". However, it noted the \"complex and sensitive\" issues dealt with and the \"new risks emerging\". It recommended the establishment of a national child protection leadership group, the development of a national child protection register, and a set of national standards for those undertaking significant case reviews. In a statement to MSPs, Mr McDonald said all 12 recommendations from the report would be taken forward. The new criminal offence would be an amendment to the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1937, the \"archaic\" wording of which Mr McDonald said was making it difficult to prosecute abusers. He told members: \"Catherine Dyer's review concludes that, in general, our child protection system works well.

The force apologised \"wholeheartedly for the additional anxiety caused\" to Sir Cliff by the force's \"initial handling of the media interest\" in its investigation. Sir Cliff was not arrested, nor charged - and last month the case was dismissed by the Crown Prosecution Service. The corporation later said it was \"very sorry\" Sir Cliff \"suffered distress\" after its coverage of the police raid but said it \"stands by the decision to report the investigation undertaken by the South Yorkshire Police and the search of his property.\" In a statement posted on Facebook on Sunday, Sir Cliff said: \"Whilst the police of course need to properly investigate allegations made to them, it is clear to me that questions need to be answered by both the police and the BBC about their initial handling of my matter, which has rightly been condemned from so many quarters, including the Home Affairs Select Committee, the broader press, and, even the police themselves. \"I chose not to comment during the active investigation for obvious reasons, but having suffered the experience that I have, I firmly believe that privacy should be respected and that police guidelines are there to be followed. \"That means that save in exceptional circumstances people should never be named unless and until they are charged. As everybody has accepted there were no such 'exceptional circumstances' in my case.\" The BBC and South Yorkshire Police said they had no comment on the statement.", "question": "Cliff Richard has instructed lawyers to make formal @placeholder complaints to South Yorkshire Police and the BBC over their handling of a police raid on his home .", "option_0": "proper", "option_1": "legal", "option_2": "public", "option_3": "civil", "option_4": "criminal", "label": 1, "wrong_label": 3}
{"article": "The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust said 27% of survivors had been targeted because of their religion or ethnicity. Their family members were even more likely to be affected, with 38% saying they had been abused. The trust polled 208 survivors of the Holocaust and Rwandan, Cambodian and Bosnian genocides, and 173 relatives. The research was released ahead of an annual event in central London marking Holocaust Memorial Day. It showed nearly three-quarters (72%) of survivors said they felt \"very\" or \"fairly welcome\" when they arrived in Britain. About half (52%) said they waited more than 20 years before talking about their experiences. Most said they did so to help more people understand what happened. Holocaust survivor, Joan Salter, was a three-month-old baby when Belgium was invaded by the Nazis. Her father was deported and her mother imprisoned. In 1943, Ms Salter was put on a boat by the Red Cross and sent to live with a foster family in the United States. She was reunited with her parents in London two years after World War Two had ended. \"It was anything but a fairytale ending though - both my parents were severely traumatised by what they'd experienced, broken in health, spirit and mind. \"Everyone deals with these things in their own ways. My mother was never able to talk about what had happened to her, it was just too painful.\" Chief executive of the holocaust trust, Olivia Marks-Woldman, said the current persecution served as a \"valuable reminder of how vital Holocaust Memorial Day is\". \"It's shocking to think that these individuals, having survived some of the very worst acts in human history, have experienced hatred and discrimination on the streets of the country that is now their refuge,\" she added. Despite more than a quarter of the survivors saying they still think about their experiences daily, 40% said their experiences had made them appreciate life more. Ms Marks-Woldman said experiences were still \"very raw\" but that survivors were determined to share their stories to help tackle intolerance and prejudice. The time it has taken people to talk about their holocaust experience suggests those who survived Rwanda and Bosnia genocides may now start to come forward, she added. \"We must all make sure we play our part in supporting them in sharing those stories, and acknowledging the terrible threats that discrimination can pose for our societies.

{"article": "A recent study showed African elephants have the most genes dedicated to smell of any mammal. The US military has also trained elephants to sniff out explosives in the South African countryside. Now an Australian zoo is harnessing an elephant's smell for a more modest aim - improving his mood. Putra Mas, Perth Zoo's only male Asian elephant, has been trained to find particular scents hidden around his enclosure. The idea came after zookeepers noticed signs of boredom, which can affect the behaviourally complex animals in captivity. Unlike the zoo's two female elephants, Putra Mas's temperament prevented him from being walked around the grounds. So keepers tried to \"brighten his day\", said Peter Mawson, the zoo's director of animal health and research. Putra Mas was taught to identify scents including lemongrass, coffee, fur, feathers and animal urine. He would squeak with each discovery. Mr Mawson said the programme had been very successful. \"It's made a noticeable difference in the level of trust between our bull elephant and his keeping staff,\" he told the BBC. \"And he certainly seems to enjoy the game. He has high expectations when he sees the setup being put in place to play the game.\" Mr Mawson said the zoo had now extended the programme to the female elephants. \"It may even be applicable to some of the other animals in the zoo, who may not be as intelligent as our elephants, and are maybe a little more difficult to work with,\" he said. \"Our big cats, sun bear, hyena and probably the painted dogs - all for whom a sense of smell is really important.\" Reporting by the BBC's Greg Dunlop", "question": "We 're often reminded that elephants have a remarkable @placeholder , but fewer people realise they possess a powerful sense of smell .", "option_0": "intelligence", "option_1": "memory", "option_2": "challenge", "option_3": "frenzy", "option_4": "nose", "label": 1, "wrong_label": 0}

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Esquire has published three sets of data online, with a full story in the next edition of the magazine on Monday. The first set is from 2007, the second from this year's Tour and the third from August's independent tests. \"My hope is more transparency can be another small step in helping rebuild trust in the sport I love,\" he said. \"The deceit of the past still casts its shadow over the present,\" added the 30-year-old. Britain's Froome says he hopes releasing the data will \"satisfy some of the questions asked\". \"I know what I've done to get here. I'm the only one who can really know 100% that I'm clean,\" he said. \"I haven't broken the rules. I haven't cheated. I haven't taken any secret substance that isn't known of yet. \"I know my results will stand the test of time, that 10, 15 years down the line people won't say, 'Ah, so that was his secret'. There isn't a secret.\" The data from 2007 was collected by the sport's world governing body, the International Cycling Union, during the Kenya-born rider's stint at the World Cycling Centre, a programme for talented athletes from developing cycling nations. The UCI blood data is incomplete by today's standards, as it predates the introduction of the biological passport in 2009. Two key tests at that point - his VO2 Max and threshold power - indicate the type of rider who could win one of cycling's biggest races, provided he lost weight to improve his climbing ability. That is also the picture painted by the tests Froome had at the GSK Human Performance Lab (GSK HPL) in London in August. On that occasion his VO2 Max, which is the peak amount of oxygen an athlete can use, was 84.6 (ml/kg/min) - readjusted for his Tour weight, that it is 88.2, a number that supports the power data Team Sky released in July from his superb victory on stage 10 at this year's Tour. That \"data dump\" was an attempt by Froome's team to defuse what was becoming a toxic atmosphere at the race. GSK HPL's senior scientist Dr Phillip Bell described Froome's VO2 Max values as being \"close to what we believe are the upper limits for humans\". As well as his independent testing results, Froome has also given Esquire biological passport blood tests from 13 July, the day before that 10th stage win, and 20 August. The first sample shows Froome's haemoglobin level (the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen) was 15.3 grams per litre, with 0.72% of his red blood cells being immature cells known as reticulocytes (produced by bone marrow in response to the body's needs). This produces an OFF-score, an equation used in anti-doping to indicate possible blood manipulation, of 102.1. The second sample shows haemoglobin of 15.3, with a reticulocyte count of 0.96%, and an OFF-score of 94.21. On their own, there is nothing about these scores that reveals anything untoward but, as British athlete Paula Radcliffe has recently discovered, they only provide a snapshot of what is happening at a particular moment and definitive proof that somebody is clean requires more data, recorded over time. That, however, is something that very few athletes have been willing or able to produce. Froome's former Team Sky team-mate Sir Bradley Wiggins told BBC Radio 5 live on Thursday his fellow Briton faced an almost impossible task in trying to convince everybody he is clean. \"I don't think [releasing his data] is going to change perceptions or what people think but at the same time that's what people have called for and he's done it,\" said Wiggins, who has also had to deal with speculation about his successes on the road - speculation he has dismissed. \"Hats off to him for doing it and I'm sure it's not going to be something that [he and Team Sky] are going to live and die by. \"I don't think it's going to change anything but it's a small step maybe.\" Froome first announced his intention to release the results of independent physiological testing during this year's Tour. As in 2013, his first victory, he was subjected to intense media scrutiny over the veracity of his performances, which spilled over into some deeply unpleasant scenes on the roadside. His team-mate and close friend Richie Porte was punched by a fan during one stage, Team Sky's cars were frequently pelted with drinks and rubbish by spectators and Froome himself was spat at and had urine thrown at him on one particularly ugly day. Froome told Esquire the accusations of doping did bother him - \"it's hard not to get angry\" - but denied they detracted from his joy at becoming the first British rider to win a second Tour title. \"Nothing is going to taint that for me,\" he said. \"All that stuff, it was an added challenge and did make it harder, but in a way it feels like an even greater achievement.\" Given what is known now about the sport's recent history of endemic doping, Froome added he understands why many cycling fans are so sceptical and accepts \"questions do need to be asked\". \"As long as the questions are fair, I'm happy to answer them,\" he said. The results of his testing at GSK HPL are expected to be published in an unspecified scientific journal at a later date, and Froome is also believed to be open to the idea of further testing in the future.", "question": "Chris Froome says he knows releasing physiological data will \" not convince everyone \" who @placeholder he twice won the Tour de France as a clean rider .", "option_0": "said", "option_1": "deserves", "option_2": "insisting", "option_3": "doubts", "option_4": "insists", "label": 3, "wrong_label": 4}

{"article": "Well, that might not be strictly true. Players combine some welcome down time following the hectic festive schedule with some training to keep themselves ticking over. But what about those who don't kick a ball in anger all year round? We asked them, and a player, for their views... On the merits of the shutdown \"It's too early to say from a Ross County perspective. Commercially, probably for a football club to shut for three weeks isn't a good thing. I'm also aware that some of our players had very little time off in the summer. At this stage of the season, you wonder whether burnout becomes a factor. \"It will probably take until the end of the season to evaluate whether it's a worthwhile exercise or not.\" Does the winter break affect your work as a chairman? \"At a football club, during the breaks where there's no football there's always more work to do, particularly in the summer as you prepare for a new season. Even at this stage of the season - because the season goes through to the middle of April - there's the split and you've got to prepare for the last five games and sell hospitality and that sort of thing. There's a lot of preparation behind the scenes and it's a time for recharging batteries for commercial and hospitality people. \"I'm talking to the manager every week of the year about how he improves the team; it doesn't really change dramatically during this period. I don't think the winter transfer window is one where there's a huge amount of activity. \"Planning more for the summer is more important. \" Is the winter shutdown long enough? \"I'm not quite sure because again it goes back to the question of summer football and whether you extend the season back into June, and how does that affect Scotland and school holidays and other things people have been doing for a good number of years in the summer. \"It goes back to the summer argument; I don't have a particular view either way. I think the experiment with the League Cup and taking it back into the middle of July - that's been good. It'll be interesting to see how people have viewed that at the end of the season and whether they want to take the season back even earlier. I have an open mind on it.\" Are you happy for the shutdown to happen every season? \"I've got an open view as this has been a funny season. With World Cup qualifiers, we've had four Saturdays where we haven't played football. So, we've had more midweek games. We find it difficult to get people [fans] in for a midweek game compared to Saturdays. I would like to hear the argument both ways. But I do think that our players who play 48, 49 or 50 weeks of the year are probably playing too much. \"We need to look at how we get the best out of players so that they can perform for, say, 40 weeks a year. That's more important. How that's divvied up? I've got an open mind and I'd like to hear the debate, from experience and also a supporter's point of view. \"Supporters play a bit part in this as well. Ultimately, without people coming to the football we don't have football. Supporters have a big say in whether they want summer football or the winter break. In Scotland, football has traditionally been played during the Christmas and New Year period. In Spain and other countries they don't do it.\" \"I kind of enjoy the winter break just after a busy and an expensive time for everybody. It gives the fans' pockets a break at an expensive time of year. Scottish football is very expensive - you're talking \u00a320-25 for a ticket, \u00a310 travel depending on where we are going and then all the other stuff that goes with it - so if you've got games Wednesday-Saturday it helps the supporters in that sense. \"On this occasion it might just actually suit Hearts to do that. It means that [new head coach] Ian Cathro and [assistant] Austin McPhee can spend some time with the players getting their ideas over. It's maybe harder putting them into practice in a game situation but it gives them time to work with the players and get to know them a bit better, and maybe get their type of player in as well to fit the system they want us to play.\" Thoughts of other Hearts fans? \"It's 50-50. Some diehard fans will want the football every week. Others are a wee bit similar to myself, they feel the break comes at a good time. The slight issue is when we have it driven by the weather, there's no guarantees in Scotland that the weather will be bad in January and good in February. It's hard for anyone to call that one. \"These days I'm more inclined to go towards summer football which was something I was always dead against until recent times, but I think it would help make our football better. Players playing in better conditions.\" Is there a fly in the ointment? \"My concern about it is - the Premiership teams are coming back to join the Scottish Cup. It's their first game back. A few years back I seem to remember a few top-flight clubs were falling at the first hurdle in the Scottish Cup because we were coming back and playing teams from what's now the Championship who were all fully match fit.\" \"I'm 100% a fan [of the shutdown]. At this time of year, the chance for us to have a little bit of time to unwind and recharge, I think from a players' point of view there'd be few complaining, to be honest.\" Should the winter break be longer? \"I suppose time will tell. If you turn up on that first game back and there's a blizzard and games are called off, I'm sure there'll be some grumblings but to me three weeks seems sensible at this point. We got a week off away and I think that was probably about right. \"Now we have a couple of weeks to get back into training and ready for games. Hopefully you'll get a set of recharged players ready to go and have a good second half of the season.\" If clubs are on a good run of form, some say the break ruins their momentum\u2026 \"I can understand it from that point of view. We'd had a couple of good results away from home up at Inverness and then a last-minute draw against Hamilton with 10 men, which felt like a victory, so maybe you want to kick on, but I think when you look at the bigger picture most people would look on [the break] favourably. The positives outweigh the negatives and I hope it's here to stay. \"You might think the fans will say they miss the football but maybe that's part of the point. Hopefully it'll recharge their enthusiasm for it.\" The first game back is in the Scottish Cup - that means some clubs are facing opposition who've not had a break\u2026 \"That argument can work both ways. We'll be going into the Rangers game [in the Scottish Cup] with a fully fit squad, which is very rare at this time of year. So I think you'd certainly be grateful for that.\" \"Mentally and physically, I think it's good for the players to get a little break. It's been a tough season so far, a lot of tough games and they sometimes need that little break, then get them back working again, and get the freshness. \"I do think the break is maybe not long enough - maybe another week or two would help us a little bit more. But I think it'll help us in the second half of the season.\" Why weren't Dundee able to get away during the break? \"Our budget doesn't let us go away for a break abroad, so we've had to find one or two games here, and it's not easy trying to get teams at this stage in the season. Most of the other teams are playing - Championship, League One, League Two - so we've had to look at our training schedule and tried to fit a couple of games in. \"We've managed to fit one in; we hoped we'd have another but we've not managed. \"I would have liked to have taken the players away into a different environment, different training facilities. We're always finding it a little bit difficult - especially this time in the season with the weather - to find decent training facilities. \"We've had to go indoors this week on a six-a-side pitch which is not ideal in terms of our preparation. I would have liked to have taken the players away but the budget just doesn't let me do that.\" Could it disrupt momentum? \"We won two out of our three games over that [festive] period so we would have liked to have continued to play. But the players have been nice and fresh this week, it was nice for them to get out of this environment, spend time with their families, go away if they wanted to, and then recharge the batteries a little bit, because it's going to be a tough second part of the season for us.\" Should the winter shutdown return? \"I would want it next year - but maybe just a bit longer and not be thrown into a Scottish Cup game when you come back. We play St Mirren, who've been playing every week, so they'll be up to speed. \"I'd like it to stay - maybe add on an extra week and have that whole month off.\"", "question": "The winter shutdown @placeholder those who follow - or feature - for Scottish Premiership clubs the chance to put their metaphorical feet up for three weeks and recharge the batteries .", "option_0": "allowed", "option_1": "remain", "option_2": "insist", "option_3": "maintained", "option_4": "offers", "label": 4, "wrong_label": 2}

Newton wrote mainly in Latin and Greek, the scientific language of his time, and was reluctant to publish. The university plans to put almost all of its Newton collection online. The papers mark the launch of the Cambridge Digital Library project to digitise its collections. As well as Principia and Newton's college notebooks, the Newton Papers section of the online library contains his \"Waste Book\". The large notebook was inherited from his stepfather, and scholars believe it helped Newton to make significant breakthroughs in the field of calculus. Newton had to be persuaded by fellow scientists Halley and Hooke to publish his works on gravity, mechanics, calculus and optics. Several of the manuscripts in the collection contain the handwritten line \"not fit to be printed\", scrawled by Thomas Pellet, a fellow of the Royal Society. He had been asked to go through Newton's papers after his death and decide which ones should and should not be published. The university had to undertake conservation work on some of the manuscripts, which were considered too fragile to be scanned. Grant Young, digitisation manager at the university library said Newton's works were chosen for the site because they were \"perhaps some of the most important papers and documents in the history of science\". \"Anyone, wherever they are, can see at the click of a mouse how Newton worked and how he went about developing his theories and experiments,\" he said. \"Before today, anyone who wanted to see these things had to come to Cambridge. \"Now we're bringing Cambridge University Library to the world.\" A further 8,000 pages of Newton's works are to be added over the next few months.

According to The Independent, the 39-year-old's work, together with his performance in upcoming Iraq war drama American Sniper, \"confirms [his] acting ascendancy is merited\". \"What he brings to this production is the weight of years of being stared at as an adult,\" wrote Ben Brantley in the New York Times.

Cooper, who was Oscar-nominated for his roles in Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle, previously played Merrick at the 2012 Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts.

The singer's first album in a decade became the fastest-selling of the year earlier this week. The Next Day is the 66-year-old's first number one since 1993's Black Tie White Noise. Although Bowie is not directly involved with curating the V&A exhibition, the David Bowie Archive gave the London museum \"unprecedented access\" to pick out flamboyant costumes, early photographs and other memorabilia. On display will be more than 60 stage-costumes including Ziggy Stardust bodysuits (1972) designed by Freddie Burretti, Kansai Yamamoto's flamboyant creations for the Aladdin Sane tour (1973) and the Union Jack coat designed by Bowie and Alexander McQueen for the Earthling album cover (1997). Personal items such as handwritten set lists and lyrics, as well as some of Bowie's own sketches, musical scores and diary entries will also be shown.

The maiden flight of the Supermarine Spitfire took place on 5 March 1936, from Eastleigh Aerodrome, now Southampton Airport. Mr Costain described flying a Spitfire as \"absolutely marvellous\". He said: \"When you first got into the seat and opened the throttle it felt as if someone had given you a good kick up the bottom and away you went. \"It would do everything you asked of it. Compared to other aircraft it was light on the controls, you could do all the aerobatics and you would come up to speed very quickly. \"If you treated a Spitfire properly, it treated you properly. Treat it roughly or be careless with it and you were in trouble, in that it would do all sorts of things such as ground looping. It also had a very fragile undercarriage and could collapse.\" Mr Costain was a member of the RAF for 37 years. He flew operational Spitfires over Europe, north Africa, the Middle East and Burma. He was also a Spitfire instructor during that time and became a test pilot on Spitfires at 9MU Cosford, Shropshire. He said: \"Everyone that joined the air force wanted to fly a Spitfire. \"I would say that I have flown nearly all of the operational Spitfires. \"There aren't many of us left [alive] that have flown the number of different marks of Spitfire that I have.\" During and since his flying days, Mr Costain says he has often been asked if he was frightened during the war years. He said: \"I was terrified, but I was terrified of letting my own friends see that I was frightened. One made one's self very determined that you wouldn't show that. \"If you were attacked when you were flying a Spitfire during the war years, you turned hard into the attacking aircraft and they just couldn't get behind you!

Disturbingly the symptoms took 24 hours to clear. The question that popped into my head was: what if someone does this every day? Do they live a life in a permanently sub concussive state? How does this affect them in older life? What about youngsters whose brains are more prone to damage? Oh we know about concussions, but we thought the days of heading an old, sodden, leather football were gone.

Theresa May is walking into a meeting with the most unorthodox president in decades, a man who today she will flatter, calling for the US and UK to \"lead together again\" as he starts to \"renew his nation\". A man who has found huge popularity among millions of voters precisely because he doesn't care for politician norms.

Customers can swap their phones via local replacement programmes, it added. Reports suggest Samsung is taking different steps in other regions to encourage people to turn in their phones. In Canada, an update reportedly turns off all the radio communications on a phone, including phone, wi-fi and bluetooth, rendering it useless. In the US, Samsung said it would issue an update on 19 December that would stop devices charging and \"eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices\". It said about 93% of all faulty phones had been returned in the US. Verizon has said it will not apply the update because of safety concerns for people who have no other phone. \"We do not want to make it impossible to contact family, first responders or medical professionals in an emergency situation,\" it said in a statement shared with tech news site The Verge. After the battery debacle, Samsung stopped global production of the Note 7. Reports of fires led to Samsung issuing a warning and asking owners to turn off their devices and hand them in.

{"article": "One of the many surprises on 8 June was how Britain appeared to have turned the clock back to the era of two party politics, with 82% of voters casting their ballot for Labour or the Conservatives. Some of the surge in Labour's support may have been down to tactical voting, with left-leaning voters spooked by the prospect of a huge Conservative majority deciding to back whichever party they believed stood the best chance of beating the Conservatives in their constituency. Which, in most cases, was Labour. But in some parts of the country the choice was made easier for them. Local electoral deals saw some would-be election candidates stand aside to avoid splitting the \"anti-Tory\" vote. But despite warm words from some Labour and Lib Dem MPs, one party ended up doing most of the heavy lifting. Of the 41 seats listed by the Progressive Alliance, one of the organisations promoting tactical voting and cross-party cooperation, where \"progressive candidates have stood aside to help another progressive candidate defeat the Tories\", 38 of them were Greens, two were Lib Dems and one represented the Women's Equality Party. Not one Labour candidate stood aside, even though it was the Labour Party that got most of the benefit, in terms of extra votes and seats. The Green Party's co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley got behind the idea of electoral alliances as a way of forcing proportional representation on to the political agenda, having spent years getting nowhere with efforts to get candidates that back electoral reform elected through first-past-the-post. Last year's Richmond Park by-election, which saw the Greens stand aside to help Lib Dem Sarah Olney defeat the then (and future) Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, had shown them what was possible and they had the backing of Green party members. But the Labour and Lib Dem leaderships refused to play ball, rejecting their offer of a formal deal at June's snap election out of hand. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC: \"I just think the electorate would be concerned if they thought parties were stitching up elections privately. I don't think that's the way forward. The way forward is to support and vote for the Labour Party.\" Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was equally dismissive, despite support for the idea among some in his party, saying the \"only plausible route of any kind towards the Conservatives not winning a majority\" was having a sizable Liberal Democrat group of MPs. It was left to local Green parties to strike their own deals, if they could. It worked in some places, most notably Brighton Pavilion, where Caroline Lucas doubled her majority, after the Lib Dem candidate stood aside, as payback for Green support in Richmond Park. But her result was a rare bright spot in a dismal night for the Greens, who failed to gain any of their other target seats, and saw their vote drop from 1.1 million in 2015 to just over 500,000. It was a bad night for smaller parties in general. UKIP saw an even more dramatic collapse in its share of the vote than the Greens. The Lib Dems also saw their vote share squeezed - but only the Greens stood aside in significant numbers to aid other parties. On the day after the election, the Green Party's co-leader Jonathan Bartlett hailed the \"brave\" decision by 24 Green candidates in marginal seats to stand aside, which he said had made a \"big difference to the election result\". But that's not how some of the candidates-that-never-were felt. Green Party activist Jill Perry, who opted not to stand in Workington, said she now has \"regrets\" about doing so because she does not think it made any difference to the result, which saw the Labour candidate Sue Hayman retain the seat with a slightly reduced majority. It also deprived local Green members and supporters - including herself - of the opportunity to vote for their party, which on nuclear power, nuclear weapons and airport expansion, to name just a few issues, is diametrically opposed to the official Labour position. \"I voted with a heavy heart because, obviously, I could not vote Green,\" she says. \"It was a very difficult decision. It wasn't a personal decision, it was a group decision, but the group was very divided with strong feelings on both sides. \"Really, I don't think it made any difference where candidates stood down\" because a lot of people voted tactically to prevent the Conservatives getting a \"massive majority\" and, as a result, \"everybody went back into the Conservative and Labour silos\". The local Labour Party appreciated their gesture but Greens had been \"put under an awful lot of pressure\" by Labour activists in areas where they refused to stand aside, she added, and some Labour activists had been \"very aggressive towards them\". \"In solidarity with those groups, I think we should stand next time,\" said Ms Perry. Andy D'Agorne, leader of the Green group on York City Council, told the BBC he does not regret standing aside for Labour at the general election but he would not do it again, unless Labour was committed to proportional representation. The Greens have strong support in York, gaining 10% of the vote at the 2015 general election in York Central, but Mr D'Agorne said the unexpected surge in the Labour vote has made it a safe seat for Jeremy Corbyn's party, rendering any future gestures of solidarity unnecessary. Nicole Haydock, co-ordinator of Bury Green Party, which opted not to run candidates in June, said the \"backlash in the party after the election\" was because \"most people thought the progressive alliance meant we are standing down where Labour has a chance of winning\" when it was actually about getting an agreement to back proportional representation. Green activist John Coyne refused to stand aside in Wirral West, despite pressure from local Labour activists and members of Momentum, to help Labour's Margaret Greenwood hang on to the seat she had won from Tory Esther McVey by 417 votes in 2015. The 429 votes Mr Coyne received in June might have made all the difference in another close contest, but Ms Greenwood was returned as Wirral West's MP with a majority of 5,365. Mr Coyne said: \"If Labour said, 'yes we want PR' then that would make a big difference but all that's happened in discussions about alliances is that there has been an attempt to get people switching from Green to Labour, there has been no element of reciprocity at all, in this relationship. \"And for that reason, if no other, I think there is no real future for it.\" The BBC understands Liverpool Green Party plans to table a motion at the party's annual conference in October to rule out future alliances unless there is a PR deal on offer. There is also the practical concern that the electoral pacts have hit the Green Party in the wallet, as Short Money is handed out by Parliament in line with the number of votes parties get. In 2016/17 the Green Party of England and Wales got \u00c2\u00a3216,994 in Short Money. It will be a lot less this year. Caroline Lucas said it was time for \"reflection and planning\" in the Green Party and has promised to listen to the membership about future electoral deals. She said it was \"clear\" that the local Green activists who stood aside in June \"helped cut down the Conservative majority\". But she added: \"The commitment to forming alliances was always about advancing significant electoral reform to give every voter a voice. \"We want to forge a new kind of politics, and simply tactical voting under first past the post does not even begin to rise to that challenge. \"Sadly there was no leadership from either Labour or the Liberal Democrats to put the urgent need for a fairer voting system at the heart of this election nationally.\" Frances Foley, campaign co-ordinator of Compass, the cross-party pressure group that set up the Progressive Alliance website and used tactics and personnel borrowed from Bernie Sanders in the US to promote it around the country, said she could understand how some Greens felt \"chastened\" by the drop in their party's vote share. But, she added, \"despite that there is still a really strong appetite for the progressive alliance in the Green Party\". There was also far more enthusiasm for cross-party cooperation, and proportional representation, among Labour activists than the party leadership, she claimed, and that change would eventually come \"from the ground up\". According to Compass's own research, \"progressive\" candidates performed 5.7% better where there was an electoral deal in place. She said the Labour leadership should view their success on 8 June as a \"shared victory,\" as a handful of Labour MPs, such as Clive Lewis, in Norwich South, and Tulip Siddiq, in Hampstead and Kilburn, had done - and it would be a mistake for them to believe they could win a general election on their own. To supporters like Ms Foley, the progressive alliance holds out the prospect of an end to petty tribal politics, as parties with similar world views - pro-European, anti-austerity, greenish - work together for what they see as the \"common good\". The combined forces of the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Lib Dems, Labour and the Green Party, as well as smaller outfits like the Women's Equality Party and the NHS party, add up to a \"progressive\" majority, they argue. More than enough to beat what they call the \"regressive alliance\" of the Tories, UKIP and the Ulster Unionists. But to have any future it is going to take a major change in attitude at the top of the Labour Party to convince the Greens and other smaller parties it is worth the sacrifice.", "question": "Left - leaning parties worked together to cut Theresa May 's majority at the general election - was it a one - off or is the \" progressive alliance \" here to @placeholder ?", "option_0": "assess", "option_1": "prevent", "option_2": "die", "option_3": "stay", "option_4": "cope", "label": 3, "wrong_label": 4}

The row, which took place on Remembrance Sunday, highlighted tensions within Labour over the role that Trident has to play in defence policy, with Mr Corbyn at odds with many of his MPs and shadow ministers over the issue.

But writing back to Mr Corbyn, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon defended the military chief's right to respond to questions about the UK's security. \"In his interview, CDS was - as he stated expressly - making a point about the credibility of the deterrent rather than any individual,\" he wrote. \"As the principal military adviser to the government, I consider it entirely proper for him to answer how we maintain the credibility of the ultimate guarantee of our security.\" He added: \"CDS is unwavering in his commitment to the principle that members of the armed forces are politically neutral and serve The Queen and he government of the day. I am confident that he will continue to uphold it. \"As you a now a member of the Privy Council, I would like to extend an invitation to meet with CDS and the other defence chiefs to discuss the current threats to our national security.\"", "question": "The defence secretary has invited Jeremy Corbyn to discuss security threats with the UK 's top @placeholder after a row between the two men .", "option_0": "crisis", "option_1": "motivation", "option_2": "powers", "option_3": "executive", "option_4": "general", "label": 4, "wrong_label": 2}

{"article": "But, his career may end in controversy after he was arrested by Brazilian police at a luxury hotel in Rio on Wednesday. When police initially called at his room, his wife told police, he had left Rio de Janeiro at the weekend and returned to Ireland. Undeterred, police began a search of the hotel and found Mr Hickey in another room that they said was under his son's name. He was escorted off the premises wearing his dressing gown to face questions about his alleged role in a scheme to sell Olympic tickets for higher than their face value - an allegation he denies. Quite a fall for a man at the top of his career. Born in Dublin in 1945, Patrick Joseph Hickey represented his country internationally in judo - a minor sport in Ireland in the 1970s. In 1979, he was appointed president of the Irish Judo Association. Five years later, he managed the Irish Olympic team at the Los Angeles Olympics. From the country's chef de mission at the 1998 Seoul and 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, he succeeded Des O'Sullivan as president of the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) in 1988. He was subsequently elected as Irish member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1995. However, he became \"a prime mover\", in the OCI's words, in July 2006, when he was elected president of the European Olympic Committees. He was re-elected in 2009. From there, he progressed on to the 15-strong International Olympic Committee in 2012. Previously described by the OCI as \"probably the top-ranked Irish administrator in the world of international sport\", the organisation said on Wednesday that Mr Hickey had stood down temporarily from his roles after being arrested during the Rio Olympics amid illegal ticket sales claims. Married with four children, the former estate agent established the firm Hickey Auctioneers in 1977. The company is now run by his daughter and eldest son.

{"article": "The BBC has heard from Britons who have already started taking steps towards obtaining dual nationality in another EU country. Some are hoping it will help them continue to live and work in the 27 other countries that make up the union while others have more ideological reasons. Name: Rachel Pilling From: London Applying for passport in: Germany Rachel has started the process of applying for German citizenship - an option that is open to her because her Jewish grandmother fled Nazi Germany in 1936 and ultimately settled in London. The naturalisation claim under article 116 of the German Basic Law allows anybody who was deprived of their German citizenship between 30 January 1933 and 8 May 1945 on political, racial or religious grounds to reclaim their citizenship.  Importantly, this also applies to any of their direct descendants. \"I previously felt there would be no benefit in having a German passport as well as a British passport but if we leave the EU, then that may well change,\" says Rachel. \"There is a real sense of sadness about this throughout my family. I have spoken to my grandmother and, while she will not be applying, she supports the idea of the rest of us doing so. Despite everything that happened in the past, she is really in favour of Europe and feels a lot of love for Europe. \"At the moment I am free to study or work anywhere in the EU. I can't be certain that it will stay that way. If there were no physical advantages with regards to studying and working abroad then I probably wouldn't apply for a German passport but this could have a big influence on my life,\" she adds. Name: Joanne Munro From: Brighton Applying for passport in: Italy or Croatia Joanne doesn't actually think having an EU passport will make much practical difference, \"except for shorter queues in the airport\", and her reasons for applying are \"symbolic\". \"I am an EU citizen and I'm not prepared to have anybody take that away from me,\" she says. \"I feel European and looking at the bigger picture in the long term, we need to be able to act as one people, on one planet. There needs to be more unity, not more division so holding onto my European citizenship and passport is a way to stay loyal to that idea.\" The 44-year-old hopes her grandmother, born in a village near Trieste in modern-day Italy, may provide her route to obtaining a European passport. Initially confident that she would be eligible for an Italian passport under the legal principle of Jure Sanguinis (right of blood), a territorial dispute over which country Trieste belonged to back in 1922 has made her quest more challenging. She may have to apply for Croation citizenship instead. \"It's an omni-shambles really but I have all of the paperwork and one way or another I am going to get a European passport,\" she says. Name: Oliver Baroni From: London Applying for passport in: Italy Oliver lives in Zurich and has both British and Swiss passports. As Switzerland is outside the European Union, the 44-year-old now faces the prospect of holding two non-EU passports. Since the result of the EU referendum, he has begun researching his Italian roots and says he is doing so for the benefit of his sons, aged eight and 18. \"It just makes me mad that my kids won't be able to travel freely in Europe to study or work,\" he says. The musician also hopes that having another passport might help make it easier for his band, The HillBilly Moon Explosion, when they tour in Europe. \"The first thing I did when it became clear that there had been a vote to leave the EU was to Google 'apply for Italian citizenship' and apparently it is not too difficult. The paperwork is likely to be a pain in the neck but it should be possible.\" Any claim made will be based on the fact Oliver's mother was born in Italy before moving to Switzerland and then the UK. Name: Damian Allinson From: Bristol Applying for passport in: Ireland Damian, who works in finance in London, is determined not to let Brexit undermine his links to Europe. The 25-year-old campaigned to remain in the EU and is chair of the London branch of the Young European Movement a group encouraging, dialogue, debate and involvement in European relations for young people. \"Like most 'Remainers', I have not only the disappointment of losing the vote but also the knowledge that I've had a lot of my hopes and career ambitions scuppered by Brexit unless I can get EU citizenship,\" he says. Damian is entitled to an Irish passport as his maternal grandfather was from County Mayo. He began work on his application before the referendum was announced because he thought it would help his plans to work in the US. \"I would have liked to have had the passport anyway but now I need it to retain my ties to the continent in terms of travel, work and culture.\" Name: Hannah Neira From: Horsham Applying for passport in: Spain Hannah's father's side of the family is Spanish and she is very close to her paternal grandparents. The 28-year-old plans to move to Spain in a few years, once her career has settled down. \"Because Brexit looks like it will put a damper on my plans to nurture my Spanish side, I contacted the Spanish embassy on 24 June to start the process of obtaining a Spanish passport,\" she says. \"I think I qualify automatically because my father has Spanish nationality, though I'm not 100% sure.\" She's keen not to lose her Anglo-Spanish identity and wants to retain freedom of movement as an EU citizen. \"Though my Spanish is quite poor, I feel connected to Spanish culture through my grandparents. I want to keep it easy to visit them whilst they are still with us.\" \"I want to get more acquainted with the country that resulted in my inherited habits of spending hours in lively debate over the dinner table, despairing when TV chefs put chorizo in a paella, talking at breakneck speed, eating garlic like sweets and hero-worshipping Fernando Alonso. \"Just as I am acquainted with the country that trained me to say \"sorry\" when someone steps on my foot, get sunburned at anything over 25 degrees, tut furiously at queue-jumpers and laugh at Blackadder.\" By Zak Brophy and Patrick Evans, BBC's UGC and Social News team", "question": "Do I have an Irish relative ?

Mr Oueremi was detained in a village close to a national park, where he had been based for more than 20 years. Some reports suggest the militia leader turned himself in. It was not immediately clear if he had been been charged with a crime. Human rights groups had criticised the new government's failure to arrest Mr Oueremi, saying that it showed it was not pursuing justice against both sides in the conflict, BBC Africa editor Richard Hamilton reports. In its September 2011 report on the post-election violence, Human Rights Watch said Mr Oueremi and his men \"were identified by multiple witnesses as among the main perpetrators of the March 29 Duekoue massacre\". Months afterwards UN peacekeepers collected arms from \"nearly 90 members\" of his group, it added. Around 3,000 people were killed in Ivory Coast after Laurent Gbagbo refused to acknowledge that his rival, Alassane Ouattara, had won a presidential run-off. Amade Oueremi's militia backed Mr Ouattara in the conflict. Mr Gbagbo is currently awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court, accused of crimes against humanity. A military commander, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss the operation, told Reuters news agency Mr Oueremi had turned himself amid signs the military was preparing for an operation to remove him from the national park. Denis Badouon, deputy mayor of Duekoue, said the militia leader had been taken into custody on Saturday morning in the village of Bagohouo, near Mount Peko. According to a UN report from May 2011 Mr Oueremi began supporting anti-Gbagbo rebels as early as 2000 and his men had been hoarding weapons and ammunition since then.

The inquiry was announced by the Northern Ireland Executive in 2010. It followed a damning report in the Republic of Ireland into decades of abuse in some religious institutions. With the inquiry set to get under way early next year, a judge said it was never intended to widen the tribunal's scope. Any extension of its remit would mean it could not complete its work on time or in budget, Belfast High Court was told. Mr Justice Treacy's verdict appears to have closed the door to others who claim they were abused while being fostered. Headed by the retired judge Sir Anthony Hart, it will examine claims of abuse in children's homes, care institutions and borstals between 1922 and 1995. The woman at the centre of the legal challenge cannot be identified. She claims she was abused after being taken into care and put into a foster home by social services in the early 1990s. Although she wanted to participate in the inquiry, she was informed earlier this year that her case did not fall within its terms of reference. Seeking to judicially review that decision, her legal team contended it was the state who placed her into foster care. According to them the inquiry is looking into any alleged failings by institutions or the state. Counsel for the inquiry argued, however, that foster care cases were never intended to be part of its remit. The court was also told of a stipulation that any judicial review proceedings must be brought within 14 days of being informed of the inquiry's decision. It made little difference whether that was in April or June this year in the woman's case, according to Mr Justice Treacy. \"The proceedings were issued in either event well outside the time limit,\" he said. \"No sufficient reason has been advanced to explain the delay, and no sufficient reason was given to persuade me that it would be appropriate to extend time.\" Dismissing the application for leave to seek a judicial review, the judge added that neither the Stormont Executive or Assembly intended the inquiry's remit to include investigating alleged foster care abuse.", "question": "A woman allegedly abused in foster care has failed in a legal challenge to being kept out of an inquiry into @placeholder abuse at children 's homes .", "option_0": "historic", "option_1": "illegal", "option_2": "amateur", "option_3": "racial", "option_4": "alleged", "label": 0, "wrong_label": 4}

He was punished for the incidents and disobedience in July 2006. Tests showed his body temperature was 41.7C, the normal temperature is 37C. Tests also showed he had ecstasy in his body when he died. Three non-commissioned officers who carried out the punishment - Sgt Russell Price, 45, Sgt Paul Blake, 37, and Cpl John Edwards, 42, were found not guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Winchester Crown Court in 2008. An inquest into Pte Williams's death, being held at Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner's Court in Salisbury, heard he had been out drinking on the weekend before his death and is thought to have taken ecstasy in a nightclub, although none of his friends saw him take drugs. When he returned to his barracks there was an incident with a fire extinguisher in which guests of an officer were sprayed with water, the inquest heard. Later that morning Pte Matthews turned up unfit for guard duty and was incorrectly dressed and smelling of alcohol, so was sent away to sort himself out and told to report to his superiors on the Monday. The following day, he was subjected to the beasting. Pte Michael Matthews drove past Pte Williams and described him being \"yakked\" - a form of extreme physical exercise - by Cpl Edwards.

O'Connell has made his name in films including Unbroken, '71 and Starred Up. Those performances helped him win the rising star prize at the Bafta film awards earlier this year. In The Nap, he will take the role of Sheffield-born snooker player Dylan Spokes who, according to The Crucible, has to contend with \"his ex-con Dad, local gangster Waxy Chuff and the snooker corruption squad\". The play is described as a \"comedy thriller\" and will be staged next March, just before the snooker world championships, which take place every April. The Nap will be directed by actor and The Crucible associate director Richard Wilson. Next week, Wilson will reprise his role as Victor Meldrew in TV sitcom One Foot in the Grave at a one-off fundraising event for the theatre. The venue's new season also includes new musical Flowers for Mrs Harris, based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Paul Gallico; revivals of A Raisin in the Sun and Waiting for Godot; and the regional premiere of Contractions by Mike Bartlett, who wrote BBC One's recent drama Doctor Foster.

{"article": "At a winding-up hearing at the High Court, Orient owner Francesco Becchetti has been given until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club. The League Two side were the subject of a winding-up petition brought by HM Revenue & Customs over unpaid taxes. Those debts have now been paid, but money is owed to four other creditors. Chief executive Alessandro Angelieri gave the court a statement saying Becchetti would invest \u00a31m to pay off remaining debts in eight to 10 weeks. Adam Michaelson, legal adviser to the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust, told BBC Radio London: \"It leaves the club in a state of significant uncertainty and frankly mortal danger. \"In respect of a potential sale, we would call upon Mr Becchetti now to look to sell the club at the earliest possible opportunity and make good on the promise that he's made.\" In January, Becchetti said he would be willing to consider selling the struggling League Two side, which he bought in 2014. The club's latest set of accounts, from the year ending 30 June 2015, showed the club had debts of \u00a35,512,449 - more than the value of the club's assets of \u00a35.5m.

Stephen Kinnock, the son of former Labour leader Neil, has become an MP after Labour held on to Aberavon. And Plaid's first female MP Liz Saville Roberts held Dwyfor Meirionnydd. Here's a list of the new MPs by constituency: Stephen Kinnock and wife, Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, arrived at the Aberavon count in Neath under the glare of media on Thursday night as Danish journalists were among those interested in the result.

Jo Stevens gained Cardiff Central for Labour from the Liberal Democrats' Jenny Willott. The Tories held Cardiff North but the party has a new MP in Craig Williams as Jonathan Evans stepped down. Liz Saville Roberts has become Plaid Cymru's first female MP to take over from Elfyn Llwyd at Dwyfor Meirionnydd. Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute to the party's outgoing parliamentary leader in March. The Conservatives have won the constituency of Gower - a seat Labour has held for more than 100 years. Following two recounts, AM Byron Davies gained the seat with 15,862 votes - a majority of just 27. Labour held the ward with Gerald Jones who has taken over from Dai Havard who was elected in 2001.

It's a good feeling to get three points from the weekend and we'll start to get some bodies back.\" On Saturday, Brett Switzer and Justin Faryna fired the Stars two up with Jared Staal scoring in reply for the Caps before Vinny Scarsella added Dundee's third. However, like last week against Fife Flyers, Edinburgh stormed back as Karel Hromas and Taylor MacDougall levelled, taking the game to overtime, where Yevgeni Fyodorov struck for the 4-3 win. On Sunday in Dundee there was quite a turnaround as five goals from Kevin Bruijsten helped the Stars to a thumping 10-3 win over Michal Dobron's side. Kevin Hart, Cam McGiffin and Bruijsten had Dundee three up in the first five minutes before Jacob Johnston pulled one back for Edinburgh. Justin Faryna and another from Bruijsten put the Stars 5-1 by the end of the first period, with the Caps mounting a comeback through Jared Staal and Karel Hromas in the middle session. But Dundee found their mojo again in the third as one from Lidhammar, Bruijsten, one from Ben Edmonds and a further two from the Dutchman completed the rout. Fife Flyers ended another weekend without a point, starting on Saturday at Manchester Storm, going down 4-3 after penalty shots. Taylor Dickin and Paul Phillips were on target for Storm before Brendan Brooks and two from Chase Schaber had Fife in front with three minutes to go. But Mario Valery-Trabucco tied the game in the final minute and after overtime couldn't produce a winner, Mark Heatley and Darian Dzuirzynski came up trumps in the shootout for Manchester. Fife welcomed Braehead Clan to Kirkcaldy on Sunday and lost for the fourth consecutive game against their Glasgow rivals, going down 4-1. Mike Hammond opened the scoring before the Flyers levelled the game through Carlo Finucci during the second period. Jay Rosehill restored Braehead's lead at the end of the second before Zach Sullivan struck with a rare goal to open a two-goal advantage when he was assisted by Alex Leavitt. Leavitt then turned scorer from provider to add a fourth that sealed the game and as Ryan Finnerty's men headed into a busy Christmas schedule with an important victory. Clan started their weekend with a 7-4 loss to Coventry Blaze, whose upturn in form saw them pick up their fourth win in their last five. TJ Syner and Robin Bergman put the Blaze in front, but Clan hit back through Matt Beca on the powerplay before Josh Godfrey restored Coventry's two-goal lead. Scott Pitt got Braehead back to one then Liam Stewart struck with a shorthanded goal.  Although Kyle Wharton got another on the board for the home team, Blaze kicked on in the third. Another one shorthanded from Stewart and Syner's second sealed the points. Corey Cowick pulled one back, but Barry Almeida rounded off a good night's work for the visitors.

Lines in the speech matched almost word for word those delivered by Mrs Obama at the Democrats' convention in 2008. Ms McIver said her offer to resign was rejected by the Trumps. \"This was my mistake, and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused,\" she said in a statement. Why the Melania plagiarism row matters Republicans react to Melania 'distraction' Teachers are thanking Melania Trump The Trump staffer said Mrs Trump had read out passages from Mrs Obama's convention speech in a phone conversation as they discussed people who inspired her. \"A person she has always liked is Michelle Obama,\" she wrote. Ms McIver later included the phrases in a draft of the speech without checking Mrs Obama's speeches, she added. \"I am honoured to work for such a great family,\" she said. Mr Trump was formally adopted as the Republican candidate for November's presidential election on Tuesday. In the aftermath of the controversy over his wife's speech, he tweeted that the publicity was good news as the speech \"got more publicity than any in the history of politics\". Mr Trump's campaign manager had emphatically denied plagiarism. Republican strategist Sean Spicer even invoked My Little Pony in an interview with CNN - citing similarities between the words of Twilight Sparkle (a purple unicorn from the children's franchise) and Mrs Trump's speech to show that the lines were \"common phrases\". Thirty-six hours later, the Trump campaign issued the press release it could have - should have - sent out in the hours after allegations of plagiarism in Melania Trump's speech first surfaced. Instead the story festered for more than a day, sucking up precious political oxygen during a week that Republicans hoped would be a showcase for the party. This will do nothing to assuage the concerns of some conservatives who wonder about the professionalism and competency of the Trump political operation. The about-face also leaves those who were ardently defending Mrs Trump over the past day and a half - such as campaign chair Paul Manafort - playing the fools. Meanwhile, Meredith McIver appears to have avoided the axe, despite her offer to resign. It seems that Mr Trump, famous for dramatically firing people for professional incompetence - he had a reality television show built around the concept, after all - will forgive what is usually viewed as a cardinal sin among speechwriters.

{"article": "The proposals are specifically aimed at reducing the high rates of teenage smokers in France. Health Minister Marisol Touraine plans to follow Australia's example, which introduced similar measures in 2012. Experts say removing branding on packets and adding large health warnings reduced smoking in Australia. However, some tobacco companies dispute the evidence for this and say France's plans are incomprehensible. Smoking is the main cause of death in France, with more than 70,000 people dying each year of tobacco-related illnesses. The new measures, which will come into effect once the law goes through the National Assembly, also includes a ban on smoking in children's play areas in public parks and in cars carrying children under 12. In addition, advertising of e-cigarettes will be restricted before being banned in May 2016, except at the point of sale and in trade publications. Ms Touraine says there are 13 million smokers in France - which has a population of around 66 million - and the \"number of smokers is growing, especially among young people.\" \"We can't accept that tobacco kills 73,000 people every year in our country - the equivalent of a plane crash every day with 200 people on board,\" she added. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the move goes well beyond what France is required to do under European anti-smoking rules. EU laws already force tobacco firms to cover 65% of the packaging with health warnings, but Ms Touraine said they would be \"the same shape, same size, same colour, same typeset\" if the ban came into effect. Celine Audibert, a spokeswoman for French firm Seita, which is a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco, described the move as \"completely incomprehensible\". \"It's based on the Australian experience which, more than a failure, was a complete fiasco,\" added Ms Audibert. In 2012, Australia forced all cigarettes to be sold in identical brown packets, largely covered with graphic health warnings. Tobacco clearances, an indicator of tobacco volumes in the Australian market, fell 3.4% in 2013 compared with 2012.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) had earlier said that tests deemed the instant noodles to contain \"unsafe and hazardous\" amounts of lead. Nestle says its noodles are safe as seen in the results of tests conducted in other countries, including the US, Britain and Singapore. Two Indian laboratories in the western state of Goa and the southern city of Mysore also recently cleared the noodles, but the findings were dismissed by India's food safety authority, saying there were lapses in the tests. Nestle said in statement on Wednesday that it had tested 2,700 samples of the noodles by several accredited laboratories in India and abroad, and each of these tests \"have shown lead to be far below the permissible limits\". But the company, which has 80% of India's instant noodles market, has already destroyed 400 million packets of Maggi products. The instant noodles arrived in India in 1983 and can be found in corner shops across the country.

The court also rejected the trust's application for NatWest to be dismissed as the executor of Savile's estate. Meanwhile, abuse survivors who met Home Secretary Theresa May on Monday said the government was creating \u00a32m fund for groups helping people who will give evidence to the forthcoming public inquiry into abuse, and a separate \u00a31.5m fund for charities which help abuse survivors. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood said it was represented at the meeting, but the Home Office has not yet announced any details.

{"article": "Doctors in Cambodia reported the complete failure of artemisinin and piperaquine - the key drugs taken to kill malaria - this year. The discovery of resistance markers, reported in the Lancet, will allow scientists to track the threat. Experts said the study was a big step forward. Artemisinin resistance has been known about for years, but a recent rise in resistance to piperaquine as well means the main malaria treatment, taking both together, is starting to fail. International groups of researchers analysed the DNA from hundreds of malaria parasites to find out how they learned to shrug off piperaquine. They uncovered genetic signatures unique to the parasites that were drug-resistant. Dr Roberto Amato, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, told the BBC News website: \"Resistance is quite widespread, there has been almost complete failure in one province in the western part of the country, and it is spreading quiet fast in the north of the country. \"The problem with complete failure is this might accelerate the spread of drug-resistance to other countries and ultimately to Africa.\" Resistance to the drugs would be catastrophic in Africa, where 88% of all malaria cases happen. Dr Amato added: \"The good news is we're starting to get clues on which treatment to use.\" Curiously, these resistant parasites appear to still be susceptible to an older drug - mefloquine. One theory is that the malaria parasites cannot resist both mefloquine and piperaquine, so doctors may be able to rotate which drugs are used. And for Dr Amato, the long-term aim is to be able to keep one step ahead of the parasite. He said: \"They evolve every single day to escape the human immune system and the insect immune system - they're extremely good at it - and we need to understand that. \"Understanding how and in which direction is crucial, if we understand the process from most basic level then we could at some point predict the direction it is going to evolve.\" Prof David Conway, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"These studies are a big step forward in our understanding. \"This evolving parasite resistance is a major threat for malaria control internationally.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "question": "Scientists have developed a way to track the spread of a @placeholder form of malaria that can not be treated with the main therapy .", "option_0": "popular", "option_1": "certain", "option_2": "powerful", "option_3": "novel", "option_4": "dangerous", "label": 4, "wrong_label": 2}

There was a record low of 85.1% in January. Mr Hunt demanded progress this year and said the target should be hit next year after new funding in the Budget. Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an extra \u00a32bn for social care over the next three years. This comes after warnings services were under threat with councils, which are in charge of services, reportedly \u00a31bn short of the \u00a319.7bn they need this year. Mr Hunt said the new money would help tackle the problem of patients who were fit to leave hospital having discharge delayed because of a lack of suitable care in the community. This is thought to have contributed to overcrowding in trusts. The health secretary said: \"It is absolutely essential we get back to the 95% target. That is critical for patient safety.\" To coincide with Mr Hunt's speech, bosses at NHS England and NHS Improvement, which run the health service, wrote to hospital chief executives giving them a deadline of March 2018 to get back on track. They said the social care money would play an important part in relieving the pressure as it could help to free up between 2,000 and 3,000 beds which are occupied by patients who have finished their treatment. If this is achieved it would represent a halving of the delays that are currently being seen. But the two regulators also want hospitals and the ambulance service to take some steps themselves.

{"article": "Spieth remains deadly accurate on the greens but Els struggles to hole the most straightforward putts. It is a sad scenario, yet the 46-year-old's enduring love of this maddening game can only be admired. Back in 2003, Els shot 31 under par to win the Mercedes Championship in Hawaii. It became the benchmark for Spieth to aim at last weekend as he romped to his eight-stroke victory in the PGA Tour's Champions Tournament. The young Texan came up only a stroke shy of Els' record as he laid down an impressive marker for the coming year. Just 22, he now has seven titles to his name and more will surely be added to the list. These are tough times for the four-time major champion as he grapples with those demons on the greens. Els was once such an elegant putter. His poise matched the grace, tempo and power of his long game. These qualities were evident to anyone who watched him win the 1994 and 1997 US Opens. On the tough layouts at Oakmont and Congressional, Els made the game look ridiculously easy. He was just 24 when he grabbed the first of those majors and back then anyone suggesting he would win only three more would have been given short shrift. Of course, Tiger Woods had yet to emerge and Els became one of the 14-time major champion's first big rivals to be taken down. Regular defeats at Woods' hands inflicted serious damage to the South African's golfing psyche. However, he still won the 2002 Open at Muirfield before taking advantage of Adam Scott's late capitulation to claim a second claret jug a decade later. This week I find myself recalling events of a year earlier, at Royal St George's. There I caught sight of Els battling through the wind and rain of the 2011 Championship, totally out of contention. The thought struck me: \"Why is he bothering?\" After all, he was about to celebrate his 42nd birthday having enjoyed a largely glittering career. He had made a fortune and there must be more to his life than this. But that discounted the competitive instincts that put the millions in Els' bank account. It didn't take account of a fire that still burned inside and a year later his persistence was more than vindicated with his victory at Royal Lytham. It was achieved with a belly-putter wedged into his midriff, a method that brought him a second life on the greens.  It is a technique no longer available, with the ban on anchored putting having been brought in at the start of this year. The R&A and the United States Golf Association (USGA) wanted to remove a crucial crutch from those unable to control involuntary hand spasms often acquired from a mileage of missed putts. So the governing bodies legislated to sort the wheat from the chaff, handing an advantage to those players who don't need to attach putters to a pivot point to make a stroke. Manfully Els has sought to embrace the demands of the new rules, but ditching the belly putter has been a painful experience. How embarrassing it must have been to become an internet sensation when he failed to hit the hole from short range during last autumn's Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. An unforgiving Twittersphere called it \"the worst putt ever\". Those who witnessed the Carnoustie calamity first hand were more sympathetic, including Ken Brown, the author of the excellent book 'One Putt' which examines the art of this most frustrating aspect of the game. \"It is gut wrenching isn't it,\" Brown said during his television commentary. \"Especially when you have been as good as he has.\" The former European Ryder Cup player notes in his book: \"It is very difficult to achieve consistency at impact without your hands working in harmony.\" Alas there was little melody in the movement of Els' mitts last week when he missed the cut at the South African Open. The second round ended with a miserable three putt. Remember this is someone with 70 worldwide wins to his name and still he will persevere. \"I love the game too much,\" he insisted. \"I'm not going to stop. I'm going to get over this by using the cross-handed method and still have fun out there.\" Els is down to 194 in the world rankings. These are desperate times; the game is anything but easy and we can only wish him well.

{"article": "In its report on the Cancer Drugs Fund, the Public Accounts Committee said it was unacceptable that the benefit to patients was still not clear. The fund was set up in 2010 to improve access to cancer drugs that would not be routinely available on the NHS. The fund, which is expected to have cost \u00a31.27bn by April 2017, has helped more than 80,000 cancer patients. Before any drugs can be given to patients on the NHS, they have to be recommended by the health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which looks at how well they work and whether they are cost-effective. But if drugs are not recommended or have yet to be appraised by NICE, the Cancer Drugs Fund can step in and choose to fund cancer treatment. The fund was initially managed by strategic health authorities. But since April 2013, it has been managed by NHS England. The MPs' committee says there is no evidence the fund is benefiting patients, extending lives or a good use of taxpayers' money. Money has had to be diverted from primary care to cover two years of overspends. The \u00a3480m budget for the two years from 2013 to 2015 was overspent by \u00a3167m. Its total budget, of \u00a31.27bn, takes the fund to April, when the system will be overhauled. The MPs recommend more thorough information is collected about how patients are benefiting from the drugs. And they say tough decisions will need to be made about spending. The fund has already had to drastically reduce the number of treatments it pays for, and the MPs' report questions whether it has done enough to fund medicines for rarer cancers.

But how effectively is Welsh politics harnessing digital power? Expert Paul Shepherd described social media campaigning by the major Welsh political parties as \"primitive\". \"It's active, engaging in places, but there is so much more that could be done by analysing social media data and reacting to the wealth of information held within,\" said Mr Shepherd, chief executive of social media agency, Coup Media. He said it reflected most of the digital campaigning across the UK, adding: \"It's disappointing because the tools and skill sets are now available to really drill down into what people think and react accordingly.\" Plaid Cymru has garnered 16,400 Twitter followers and 15,244 \"likes\" on Facebook - the most received by any Welsh party. Mr Shepherd, whose company has offices in Newport and London, said the party had partly taken \"the humorous route\". One of its promotional videos, which has been viewed more than 6,000 times, begins with a young man confessing to his parents he has a personal secret. \"There is something I need to tell you,\" he says, adding after a strained pause: \"I'm voting Plaid\". Figures uncovered earlier this year showed the Conservatives were spending \u00c2\u00a3100,000 a month on Facebook across the UK. Mr Shepherd said the Welsh Conservatives had been tactically \"good\" at breaking down video content by topic, such as those on the NHS and the Budget. However, he said the execution was \"poor\". The party has 1,598 Twitter followers and more than 5,500 Facebook \"likes\". Welsh Labour's Twitter account, which has 6,350 followers, was \"extremely active\" with a large number of responses to its posts, including celebrity endorsements from the likes of Eddie Izzard, Mr Shepherd observed. Its Facebook page has 1,482 \"likes\". However, a Labour advert starring The Hobbit actor, Martin Freeman, had an \"unexpectedly\" low amount of views on the Welsh Labour YouTube channel. Welsh Liberal Democrats has 4,064 Twitter followers and more than 2,000 Facebook \"likes\". The party's promotional video on YouTube depicts leader, Kirsty Williams, addressing the camera, intercut with supporters giving positive comments from their doorsteps. Mr Shepherd said the party's Twitter feed was not as active as others but its Facebook page had a better mix of \"pushing policy and attacking other parties\". The Green party's Twitter account, which has 2,787 followers, is a \"lot less confrontational\" than its rivals and more focused on itself, he added. But its engagement was slightly lower, \"with re-tweets and 'Favourites' not as high as some of the other parties\". Mr Shepherd noted that the UK Independence Party's twitter account, which has under 600 followers, used \"a lot\" of re-tweets. He said this suggested the party was \"curating rather than creating content\", which could signify \"a lack of confidence in policy or just lazy Twitter strategy\". Mr Shepherd urged the parties to pay more attention to the way the public interacted with their online content. \"It's all a huge source of intelligence that, when treated correctly, can give you the insights that will give the edge over the competition,\" he added. \"It also shows the electorate that you're doing the most important thing - listening.\" Elizabeth Linder, politics and government specialist of Facebook UK, said last month social media would be \"absolutely at the heart\" of political campaigning across the UK.", "question": "Commentators have suggested the 2015 UK general election will be the first to be significantly @placeholder by websites like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube .", "option_0": "provoked", "option_1": "determined", "option_2": "supported", "option_3": "targeted", "option_4": "overseen", "label": 1, "wrong_label": 3}

Mr Trump had previously said he would donate his entire annual salary. But critics quickly pointed out his donation went to an agency he wants to cut by more than a billion in funding. Mr Trump's budget proposal calls for a 12% ($1.5bn) cut to the Interior Department, which oversees the National Park Service. Mr Zinke said he was \"thrilled\" by Mr Trump's donation, adding that it would be used for maintenance on the nation's battlefields. During the presidential campaign, Mr Trump vowed to give up his annual salary of $400,000 if elected. Last month, Mr Spicer said the president would donate his entire salary at the end of the year, asking members of the media to weigh in on what he did with the cash to \"avoid scrutiny\". But Mr Trump's move was still scrutinised on social media, with users noting that his donation would pay for something as little as two hours of security at his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago or half a day's worth of security at Trump Tower. The environmental group Sierra Club also was quick to respond on Twitter, calling Mr Trump's donation a \"distraction that falls far short of the $12 billion needed to address the current backlog of park maintenance\". \"America's parks, and the people and economies they support, need real funding, not a giant fake check,\" the group tweeted. Meanwhile, some Trump supporters lauded the president's move. Mr Trump clashed with the National Park Service shortly after he sworn into office.

{"article": "Or maybe it didn't. The subject in question was the tragic deaths of John Yuill and Lamara Bell. Lamara lay trapped in a car for three days after an accident on the M9. The initial accident was apparently reported but not followed up by police. On Tuesday, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland published a report into call handling by Police Scotland in the aftermath of that incident. The report made 30 recommendations to improve the system. But it was emphasised that Tuesday's report did not investigate police action with regard to the specific case on the M9. That task falls to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner. Which resulted in the disjuncture at Holyrood today. Labour's Kezia Dugdale and the Conservatives' Ruth Davidson both pursued the first minister. Ms Dugdale said Tuesday's report amounted to a \"damning assessment\" of the Scottish government in that it was ministers who conjoined Scotland's forces into Police Scotland. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was ducking nothing. All 30 recommendations had been accepted. All 30 recommendations would be implemented. But the report, she stressed, said nothing about the tragic events on the M9. She offered sympathy to the families involved, as did others. But were Scottish Ministers generically culpable? Both Ms Dugdale and Ms Davidson said that the establishment of Police Scotland had been mishandled. Ms Davidson went further and said that ministers were attempting, wrongly, to \"pass the buck\" onto Westminster in the shape of claims about cuts in expenditure. She said that the Scottish budget had increased in cash terms by some \u00c2\u00a3661m while the budget for policing had reduced by \u00c2\u00a36m, year on year. In response, Ms Sturgeon noted that both Labour and the Conservatives had supported the introduction of a single police force. She argued that every effort had been made to smooth transition. Further, she said, one purpose of the merger had been to save money. It was not surprising, therefore, that the police line in the budget was lower. That did not mean services had been cut. Scotland's overall budget had faced a real terms cut, she said. It would have been decidedly helpful on this occasion to hear from Willie Rennie, the Liberal Democrat leader. His party opposed the concept of a single force from day one. However, the paucity of Lib Dems at Holyrood mean he is not entitled to a question every time the FM faces such inquiries.

Over the weekend, former Home Secretary Lord Howard said the prime minister would defend Gibraltar the same way that Margaret Thatcher had protected the Falklands. But on Monday, Jack Straw, the former home secretary and foreign secretary who organised a referendum on the status of Gibraltar in 2002, said the idea of conflict with Spain over the territory was absurd. He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that Spain was unlikely to let Gibraltar get in the way of a future EU trade deal with the UK. \"Spain has hugely more invested in their trade and relations with the UK,\" he said, adding that Spain exports more to the UK than it imports from the UK, which means it has a balance of trade surplus. The most recent figures broken down by country are from 2015.

Top flight and Championship stadiums have had to be all-seater since terraces were outlawed in the aftermath of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Safe-standing areas, featuring retractable seats, are used at Celtic and abroad, notably in Germany. Premier League chiefs have acknowledged a \"softening\" around the topic of standing clubs, with an improved atmosphere cited as one of the benefits, and clubs have agreed to hold further talks in the new year. But some clubs - including Everton - are against it and it would need government legislation to change if safe standing was introduced at stadiums in England. United contacted season-ticket holders on Thursday and included the question in a 20-point survey. Supporters were asked for the three areas of Old Trafford - the biggest club ground in the UK, with a capacity of 75,635 - that they would prefer standing to be introduced. It is believed to be the first time a Premier League club has surveyed its fans about the idea of bringing standing back to English grounds. Jon Darch, who runs the Safe Standing Roadshow, which promotes the use of rail seats, said: \"I am sure that the level of interest will be huge and look forward both to hearing the results and to seeing other Premier League clubs follow suit and ask their fans if they would also like to be formally allowed to stand at games in dedicated areas of rail seating, specifically designed for safe standing.\" The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 resulted in the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans following crushing on the terraces. There have been no standing areas at Old Trafford since 1994.

The Azerbaijani champions were no easier to contend with in the second half, though goalkeeper Ibrahim Sehic's stunning save denied Virgil van Dijk. However, Kris Commons' cross found Boyata, who headed in from six yards. A fractious night at Celtic Park but a precious victory, and a clean sheet, for Ronny Deila's team in this Champions League third qualifying round tie, ahead of next Wednesday's second leg. In the days before this match, Celtic made big play of the respect they had for the visitors, citing their impressive results in the Europa League last season and reminding their supporters that this tie could be an almighty grind. And a grind it was. Qarabag created little or nothing but in their pursuit of a cushion, Celtic toiled in the opening half. There was a lack of accuracy in their play, a lack of wit to cut open a visiting defence that was cool for the most part. Save for a tame Mackay-Steven shot and a snappy Richard Almeida free-kick that rebounded off Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon to safety, there was precious little to excite. Qarabag looked comfortable at the back. Fearless, even. More than once they played intricate passing in their own penalty area where others might have panicked. Their ease was a polar opposite to the anxiety of the home support - big in number and big in angst. That mood was only added to in the minutes before Boyata freed them from their footballing purgatory. Celtic carved out decent openings early in the second half, two of them falling to Nadir Ciftci and both of them missed. The first a header that flashed wide of Ibrahim Sehic's goal and the second thumped straight down the goalkeeper's throat. Midway through the half, Van Dijk thumped a magnificent header on Qarabag's goal only to see Sehic make a save from the Gods. Soon after, the Dutchman lashed a shot over Sehic's crossbar. Deila emptied his bench in search of inspiration. James Forrest came on for the hushed Stuart Armstrong. In a statement of intent, Leigh Griffiths, a striker, replaced Nir Biton, a holding midfielder. Then Commons appeared in place of Ciftci. And it was Commons' delivery that finally unlocked Qarabag. When Boyata stole in ahead of Sehic to score it released a pressure valve inside Celtic Park. In the process, it gave his team a vital lead on the tortuous journey to the white heat of Baku next week. Match ends, Celtic 1, FK Qarabag 0. Second Half ends, Celtic 1, FK Qarabag 0.

{"article": "Atari, the company behind some of the most popular early video games, has filed a suit alleging Nestle knowingly exploited the game's look and feel. The advert showed a game similar to Breakout but where the bricks were replaced with single Kit Kat bars. Nestle said it was aware of the lawsuit and would defend itself \"strongly\" against the allegations. Breakout was created as a successor to \"Pong\" by Apple founders, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. In the advert, which is titled \"Kit Kat: Breakout\", a row of people, of varying ages and appearance, share a sofa and play a video game during their work break. In the game depicted, a primitive paddle moves side-to-side to bounce a ball into a collision with the horizontal bars ranged across the top of the screen. Atari alleges that the similarity with its original game \"is so plain and blatant that Nestle cannot claim to be an 'innocent' infringer\". The legal complaint against Nestle, filed in a San Francisco court on Thursday, claims that the Swiss chocolate maker had hoped to exploit \"the special place [Breakout] holds among nostalgic Baby Boomers, Generation X, and even today's Millennial and post-Millennial 'gamers'\". Nestle's spokesperson said: \"This is a UK TV advert that ran in 2016.

In return it wants Labour to agree not to contest the Totnes seat. Dr Sarah Wollaston, Conservative MP for Totnes, described the plans as \"anti-democratic\". The Green Party said it was \"early days\" but it hoped arrangements could be made locally with the Labour Party. More on the pact story, plus more Devon and Cornwall news It follows a letter from the party's leadership to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron for similar deals around the country. Dr John Green, South Devon Green Party chairman, said: \"I think people want a Parliament elected that better represents the views of the electorate. \"I believe our voters would prefer some sort of progressive alliance that would ensure the Tories don't have a majority in the next Parliament.\" Plymouth Sutton is the most marginal seat in the South West. It is traditionally a Tory-Labour contest. The Conservative defender Oliver Colvile held on in 2015 but by just 523 votes. The Greens got more than 500 votes so the logic is pretty obvious. Arguably the perfect seat for this is St Ives in Cornwall which was Lib Dem from 1997 to the last election. There the Green vote alone, had it switched to the Lib Dems, would have seen the Lib Dem holder hold the seat. And the previous Lib Dem MP Andrew George has done lots of campaigning with the Green Party's Caroline Lucas, so there could be a perfect fit there. Mr Colvile said: \"I was the underdog in this constituency and I'm not going to try and pre-judge what would happen if there was a deal.\" Luke Pollard, Labour's election co-ordinator for the ward, said the party was \"fighting to win\" and he was not aware of any contacts for a pact with the Greens. \"I was as surprised as anyone when I heard about it,\" he said. Dr Wollaston said: \"It looks anti-democratic\" for a \"small group of people dividing this up between them\". Devon County Council's Liberal Democrat group has an arrangement where five councillors have an alliance with two Greens.

{"article": "There have been some high-profile cases here. Breitbart reported that a mob attacked Germany's oldest church, St Reinold's Church in Dortmund. The website has subsequently published a lengthy defence of its original article, together with an admission that it is not in fact the oldest church in Germany. I visited the church and spoke at length to locals, including a pastor who works in the city (and was named in the Breitbart report), and a local refugee support worker. They were unanimous in the view that the Breitbart report misrepresented true events in service of an anti-Islamist agenda that was divisive and unjust. In Berlin, I spoke to Anas Modamani, a 19-year-old Syrian who enjoys taking selfies. So much so that three weeks after turning up in the German capital, having come from the outskirts of Damascus via a boat trip, Turkey, Greece and Macedonia, he took a selfie with Angela Merkel, who was visiting his hostel. It promptly went viral, together with the false claim that he was a terrorist. He is now suing Facebook. Germany's political class wants to take action. Lars Klingbeil, a fast-rising star of the Social Democratic Party who is a close associate of Martin Schulz, told me his plan to tackle fake news. Perhaps Damian Collins, the Tory chairman of Parliament's culture select committee here, who has launched an inquiry into fake news, could pick up some ideas. Facebook now employs independent fact-checkers here. Correctiv is a smart outfit whose employees are mostly young. Correctiv monitors suspicious stories, looking at how much they are being liked and shared. If the headline looks suspicious, or it appears on a website known to be dubious, the Correctiv team will contact the original sources for the story, to verify if it's true or not. They then mark it true or false, and send a message to all German users of the social media platform, indicating its rectitude or otherwise. They don't accept money from Facebook, because they want to retain total editorial independence. But they too are a sign of how, outside of America, Germany is leading the fight against fake news. Read more: Based on my conversations here, there are several reasons why Germany has got ahead of the curve on this important issue. First, Mrs Merkel's refugee policy is hugely controversial, and has galvanised that part of the political spectrum that, thus far, has shown the greatest propensity for creating fake news internationally: the nationalist far-right. It turns out letting in a huge number of refugees is a good way to mobilise purveyors of fake news. Second, because of Germany's 20th Century history, there is a hyper-sensitivity about the rise of that far-right. The success of Alternative for Germany, a nationalist party, and the ever-present but low-level threat from neo-Nazi groups make many Germans determined to act fast. Third, the traditional media sector here is very different to those of Britain and America. The most influential newspapers are staid rather than raucous; the cable news channels are more BBC or CNN than Fox News, and talk radio has nothing like the oomph that is generated by the likes of Rush Limbaugh or, now on LBC, Nigel Farage. Germany's conventional media market has created an opening for fake news, which of its very nature is salacious and exciting. Fourth, there have been several high-profile cases. The Modamani case is perhaps the most notorious. Groups like the Resistance of German Patriots have been happy to spread nationalist propaganda, with a limited regard for facts. Fifth, my sense is that Germany retains a strong belief in the competence and capability of government. If there is a social problem, goes this thinking, perhaps it is capable of a political solution, by virtue of smart regulation. That was the impression Mr Klingbeil gave, but the belief that fake news should be combated by regulation is not restricted to social democrats: Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats are also putting pressure on Facebook to make it easier for users to flag suspicious content and delete posts, while those targeted by fake news would be given a right of reply. Sixth, there are local and national elections coming. Fearing a repeat of America's recent experience, where fake stories went viral and may have influenced some voters, Germany believes prevention is better than cure. And Facebook, damaged by the fallout from fake news about Donald Trump, appears to agree. Fake news is not a problem that is going to disappear soon; nor is it one that any journalist can ignore, or be neutral toward. It behoves all of us in this trade - at least those of us who retain a belief that truth is possible and necessary - to wish Germany success in this fight.

{"article": "Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders have been making progress on key issues since talks in Geneva began on Monday. Earlier, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said a deal on reunifying the island was \"very close\" but cautioned against hopes of a \"quick\" fix. The island's communities have been split since 1974. Key stumbling blocks to reaching a deal include the return of property to tens of thousands of Cypriots who fled their homes in 1974, and the question of whether any Turkish troops will remain in northern Cyprus after reunification. Turkey still has 30,000 troops stationed in the island's north, whose presence Greece opposes. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said discussions were \"at a critical juncture\" and that technical experts would now hold talks. Reports say the plan is for their meetings to begin on 18 January, with a focus on thorny security issues. Property: What should happen to the properties that Greek Cypriots had to abandon in 1974? Should they get the right to take their old homes back, or be compensated - and if so by how much? Security: How can the security of the Turkish Cypriots be guaranteed if Turkey's estimated 30,000 troops leave? Greek Cypriots see them as an occupying force, so should some stay or should Turkey retain the right to intervene? Who would act as a guarantor of the deal? The EU, of which Cyprus is already a member, or the UK, which has two military bases on the island? Power and the role of the EU: There is talk of a rotating presidency, but how would that work? And could a Turkish Cypriot president really represent the country from time-to-time at EU summits? Territory: How much more territory should Greek Cypriots gain to reflect the fact that they make up the majority of the island's population? UN peacekeeping forces estimate that 165,000 Greek Cypriots fled or were expelled from the north, and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south, although the parties to the conflict say the figures are higher. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias said himself, Mr Cavusoglu and UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who represent Cyprus's security guarantors - could meet again on 23 January. The end goal is for the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to share power in a two-state federation.

A 40,000-name petition was handed to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport by the PCS supporting its case. The dispute worsened when union rep Candy Udwin, who was involved in talks at the conciliation service Acas, was suspended on the eve of the strike. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: \"With this privatisation plan, the National Gallery is putting its well-earned worldwide reputation at risk. \"Its decision to suspend one of our senior reps is a disproportionate and unfathomable act of bad faith and not only should she be reinstated immediately, gallery officials must commit to reopening full and proper negotiations.\" A National Gallery spokesman said all planned education events had been cancelled or rescheduled due to the action. He added: \"The negative impact this strike action makes on our education events is significant and damaging. \"The most acutely affected area is the National Gallery's programme for schools and teachers, which included daily sessions for primary aged children including children with special educational needs.\" The spokesman said: \"From April, we will pay staff a top-up which will bring salaries in line with the London Living Wage. \"As a result of the PCS position, we will now appoint an external partner to manage these services.

The UN fears for tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the fighting. The area between the city of Aleppo and the Turkish border is split between IS, rebel and government-controlled zones. A nationwide, but often violated ceasefire, between rebel and government forces, brokered by the US and Russia in February, does not include jihadist groups such as the self-styled Islamic State. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said heavy clashes had taken place inside the walls of Marea overnight between IS fighters and rebels. Marea has long been a bastion for non-jihadist rebel forces who have been fighting  President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's five-year conflict. It lies within the so-called Azaz corridor - a key rebel lifeline of supplies that links Aleppo city with the Turkish border but which has previously been severed by government and Russian air strikes. Azaz, 20km (13 miles) north of Aleppo, itself hosts tens of thousands of displaced civilians. The IS militants' offensive initially captured six villages around Azaz and took them to within a few kilometres of the city, cutting off supplies to Marea to its south. It is thought some 15,000 residents remain in Marea. The UN's refugee agency said it was deeply concerned about the plight of more than 160,000 displaced people who are massed in the north of the country. It said fleeing civilians were being caught in the crossfire of the IS offensive, and that they were struggling to get access to food, water and medical services.

{"article": "It could lead to new ways of diagnosing the condition and of testing the effectiveness of new drugs. The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living brain clumps of a protein called tau that is closely linked to the disease. Alzheimer's Research UK said it was promising work. Alzheimer's disease is a problem for researchers trying to come up with a cure. The brain starts to die years before any symptoms are detected, which means drugs are probably given too late. A diagnosis of Alzheimer's cannot be made with absolute certainty until a patient has died and their brain is examined. It is also not 100% clear what is the cause of the dementia and what are just symptoms. One protein, called tau, is very closely linked to the disease, with tangles of tau thought to be one way in which brain cells are killed. The team, lead by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba, used positron emission tomography to build a 3D picture of tau in the brain. They developed a chemical that could bind to tau and then be detected during a brain scan. Tests on mice and people with suspected Alzheimer's showed the technology could detect tau. Dr Makoto Higuchi, from the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan, said: \"Positron emission tomography images of tau accumulation... provide robust information on brain regions developing or at risk for tau-induced neuronal death.\" The research is at an early stage, but it could eventually lead to an actual test for Alzheimer's disease. It might also allow researchers to closely follow the impact drugs that affect tau have on the brain. Another protein - beta amyloid - is also linked to Alzheimer's and can be detected in similar tests. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"This promising early study highlights a potential new method for detecting tau - a key player in both Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia - in the living brain. \"With new drugs in development designed to target tau, scans capable of visualising the protein inside the brain could be important for assessing whether treatments in clinical trials are hitting their target. \"If this method is shown to be effective, such a scan could also be a useful aid for providing people with an accurate diagnosis, as well as for monitoring disease progression.\"", "question": "Pioneering brain imaging that can detect the build - up of @placeholder proteins linked to Alzheimer 's has been developed by Japanese scientists .", "option_0": "free", "option_1": "radical", "option_2": "destructive", "option_3": "specific", "option_4": "various", "label": 2, "wrong_label": 3}

A police source told the BBC's Simon Hall it has \"no choice\" but to ask the government for help. The force has not commented. The Home Office said it was not in discussions with individual forces about A19. More than 1,000 former senior police officers across England and Wales are seeking compensation after being forced to retire. An employment tribunal in February 2014 decided there had been age discrimination, but police forces appealed against the ruling and judgment is expected by the end of May. The source told the BBC the sums involved in the case \"could run into tens of millions of pounds\", depending on the details of the judgment, adding it would be \"completely unaffordable given how forces have already suffered severe budget cuts\". Officers from Devon and Cornwall, Nottinghamshire, West Midlands, North Wales and South Wales took part in the legal challenge. The officers concerned tend to be among the highest paid and many would have been forced to retire aged around only 50. If they could show they wanted to work for several more years, that suggests a total compensation bill of tens of millions of pounds. The actual calculation a tribunal would carry out is complex, but even such rough guesses illustrate why - given the context of the budget cuts police forces have already implemented - there is so much concern amongst senior officers about the outcome of the A19 case.

{"article": "I include in that the anti-Americanism that surrounded the invasion of Iraq and the trauma of the financial crash. Dispirited. Back in 2004 and 2008 Americans were by and large united, or at the very least they were not so angrily divided. One might think that the sight of swastikas on American streets would indeed unite the country in unwavering purpose. Not so. The country is so mired in political division that even Nazi symbols have become political symbols some can live with if they feel that condemning them would give succor to their opposition. And the man running the country is actively widening that divide. There's little point parsing the rationale of President Trump's defence yesterday of the \"fine people\" who took part in the white supremacist march in Charlottesville. I doubt he himself was even trying to make a reasoned case. I suspect that rant of a press conference was driven more by his sense of personal grievance - his anger at being attacked over his initial response to Charlottesville - than by his views on race. But Mr Trump's failure to unambiguously and repeatedly condemn those far-right, racist groups gives them oxygen and strikes a blow at the heart of American identity. American prides itself on being centrist, on not having the European tendency of flirting with extremist groups. Respected veteran political commentators have often told me that the US always gravitates to the centre ground. It sure didn't look like that in Charlottesville - ask Germany, or Italy, or Spain. And if America is going to become just another country, albeit with a lot more weapons, no wonder the world is revising its opinion. Dismissive. The degree to which Americans talk about themselves as a special, unique country has often struck me as a little grandiose. You don't hear the French, or Brits, or Australians talk about themselves that way - though they may well feel it. But perhaps it takes the loss of that uniqueness to make us realise how real it was and how much the world relied on it. This summer I spent time in the UK, France and Spain. In all three countries, leaders are trying to figure out how to get by without American leadership on critical issues like climate change and trade, while the general publics increasingly see the US as a non entity. It's not even seen as a joke, people are saddened by America's diminished global status. Europeans have long had a complicated and somewhat insecure relationship with the US, part admiration, part jealousy, part irritation. But this year the reaction in Europe to America felt different. Continental Europe is feeling more confident, the economy is doing better and far right groups have been defeated at the ballot box. Even Britain's decision to withdraw from the EU doesn't get much attention - Brexit is old news in France and Germany. That newfound confidence, mixed with America's clear dysfunction, does indeed create a sense of dismissiveness. For many Europeans, indeed many foreigners, Trump is a spectacle, a reality show on steroids. But that's about the sum of Europe's interest in America right now. Mr Trump's approval ratings are slipping fast. The overwhelming majority of Americans are appalled by all that the hideous scenes in Charlottesville represent. Nothing is getting done in Congress. No wonder Americans are feeling disheartened.

{"article": "The move comes three years after Allison rejoined Ferrari as part of a restructuring plan to improve the team's performance. The first car designed under his control won three races in 2015, but Ferrari's revival has stalled this season, with no wins so far. Mattia Binotto has been promoted to chief technical officer. His previous role was as head of Formula 1 power-units. Allison, 48, was also at Ferrari as head of aerodynamics during the dominant Michael Schumacher era of 2000 to 2004, before moving back to the Renault team, where he was deputy technical director when Fernando Alonso won consecutive titles in 2005 and 2006. He is one of the most highly regarded engineering leaders in F1 and is likely to be of interest to a number of other teams. He said in a statement issued by Ferrari: \"During the years I spent at Ferrari, at two different stages and covering different roles, I could get to know and appreciate the value of the team and of the people, women and men, which are part of it. \"I want to thank them all for the great professional and human experience we shared. I wish everybody a happy future with lots of success.\" Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said: \"The team would like to thank James for his commitment and sacrifice during the time spent together, and wishes him success and serenity for his future endeavours.\" Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne has recently been conducting a review of the operational practices of the team, including consulting engineers on all levels, in an attempt to inject more creativity into the team. This has included a restructuring of the internal workings of departments across Ferrari. Allison's next destination is yet to be decided but his reputation is such that he would be of interest to most teams. McLaren were keen to sign him at the start of 2013, but he ultimately turned them down to go back to Ferrari. And the Enstone-based Renault team, where Allison has worked on three separate occasions, is undergoing a major rebuilding programme following the French company's buy-back of the operation from former owner Genii Capital, which ran it as Lotus from 2012-15.

Age Scotland's research, compiled using freedom of information requests, found significant variations across councils in the time taken to carry out assessments. Under national guidelines, people should wait no longer than six weeks for care services to be provided after an assessment has taken place. Age Scotland found that about 10% of people were not provided with services within the six-week limit over the past three years. The charity said its research suggested that about 3,000 elderly people each year wait longer than six weeks for services to be put in place. Most councils do not record the reasons why delays occur, but many cited instances where delays were caused by the person being admitted to hospital or waiting for a place in their chosen care home. Staff shortages, financial constraints and delays in adapting homes were also cited. Age Scotland received freedom of information responses from 25 out of 32 councils.

Nishikori takes on Marin Cilic in the evening session at 20:00, with the Japanese player also able to claim one of the two semi-final places from the John McEnroe Group. Murray needs to qualify for the last four to maintain his hopes of ending 2016 as the world number one, ahead of Novak Djokovic. The only way Murray can be eliminated after winning his opening two matches is with a straight-set defeat by Wawrinka, followed by a Nishikori win over Cilic.

Mr Mackinlay defeated the then UKIP leader Nigel Farage in the ballot.

Seventeen police forces across the country are looking into whether some MPs' agents should have filed costs associated with battle bus visits to their constituencies in their local expenses. The Tories said they had been campaigning \"across the country for the return of a Conservative government\" and, as a result, associated costs were regarded as national not local expenditure. Mr McCartney has accused Conservative Central Office (CCHQ) of keeping back from MPs a draft report from the Electoral Commission on the investigation. In an email leaked to Sky News, he wrote to the party chairman, Patrick McLoughlin saying MPs felt \"completely cast adrift\" and \"left to fend for themselves\".

Over the past three weeks many players of the popular multi-player game Guild Wars 2 have been complaining about the activities of a character called DarkSide.

Via a series of exploits the character was able to teleport, deal massive damage, survive co-ordinated attacks by other players and dominate player-versus-player combat.

The videos helped ArenaNet's security head Chris Cleary identify the player behind DarkSide, he said in a forum post explaining what action it had taken. Mr Cleary took over the account to carry out the punishment. The video shows DarkSide being stripped to his underwear then made to leap from a high bridge in one of the game's cities.

In its own statement, Google said: \"We don't comment on individual employees.\" Rob Halfon, Tory MP for Harlow, told the Guardian that the news was a \"shocking revelation\". \"Now it seems they [the ICO] have had a cosy relationship with the company they have been investigating,\" he             told the newspaper . Mr McCartney was head of data protection promotion at the ICO where he had worked,             according to his LinkedIn profile , since 2004. During this time, the ICO conducted an investigation into allegations that Google had knowingly gathered personal data while collecting photographs as part of its Street View mapping project. The ICO ruled that there had been a \"significant breach\" of the Data Protection Act, but opted not to fine the company, a decision heavily criticised by campaign group Privacy International and others. Of the 2010 investigation, deputy information commissioner David Smith told the BBC: \"We spent less time searching than others did.

Judge Daniel Rafecas has concluded that there was not enough evidence to pursue the charges. The accusation came from special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was found dead last month in his flat. Judge Rafecas said he was throwing out the case after carefully examining Mr Nisman's 350-page report. There was no proof that an agreement signed by the Argentine government with Iran in January 2013 was an attempt to shield the involvement of senior Iranian officials in the attack, the judge said. The agreement was rejected by the Iranian government two months later and was never approved by Iran's parliament. Defence Minister Agustin Rossi welcomed Judge Rafecas' ruling saying: \"We have always said that Nisman's claims had no legal basis.\" The case has dominated the Argentine press for the past six weeks, and this latest development has only driven media interest to new heights. Several commentators reflect the sense of relief the ruling is likely to have prompted inside the presidential palace. \"Rafecas has given Cristina space to breathe,\" Adrian Ventura writes in the La Nacion daily, while Clarin's Eduardo van der Kooy comments that Ms Fernandez will now be able to give her last speech to Congress on Sunday with a \"less sullied image\". But in the Buenos Aires Herald, Luciana Bertoia is more sceptical, writing \"CFK in the clear (for now)\". Noticeably absent is any comment from Ms Fernandez herself. The normally Twitter-friendly president has yet to address her 3.59 million followers about the ruling. The case against Ms Fernandez and Foreign Minister Hector Timerman is now closed. But the BBC's Wyre Davies says the judicial system in Argentina is highly politicised and the decision to cease investigations will further polarise a divided nation. Mr Nisman was due to testify in Congress against Ms Fernandez and Mr Timerman the day after his body was found. The circumstances of his death have not been clarified. President Fernandez said Mr Nisman been fed misleading information by a rogue intelligence agent. The government has rejected any role in his death. The lower house of the Argentine Congress has meanwhile approved a bill scrapping the country's secret agency, the Intelligence Secretariat. The proposal was first announced days after Mr Nisman's death, on 18 January. A new federal investigative agency, which will be accountable to Congress, will replace it. Ms Fernandez said the change was overdue because the agency had remained largely untouched since the end of military rule in 1983. The opposition called the proposal a smokescreen for its involvement in the scandal.", "question": "A federal judge in Argentina has dismissed a @placeholder case against President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her foreign minister .", "option_0": "controversial", "option_1": "major", "option_2": "similar", "option_3": "daring", "option_4": "fresh", "label": 0, "wrong_label": 4}

Caroline Flint and Siobhain McDonagh said they were disappointed there had not been a full disciplinary inquiry. The appointment of Mr Fisher, an economist and former trade union official, to Mr Corbyn's inner circle caused concern among some Labour MPs who questioned statements he had made in the past. The policy adviser wrote a tweet in August 2014 appearing to endorse the Class War candidate in the Croydon South constituency rather than Labour's candidate Emily Benn. He has since apologised, insisting he had been \"misinterpreted\". Other tweets posted from his account, which has since been deleted, were critical of Labour frontbenchers while one message appeared to welcome former shadow chancellor Ed Balls losing his seat in May. A Labour Party spokeswoman said the NEC had completed its probe into Mr Fisher and that he had been \"issued with an NEC warning and his suspension has been lifted with immediate effect\".

{"article": "Researchers at the University of Glasgow were part of an international project looking at personality types and friendships among students. It suggested those with \"excessively positive self-regard\" were the initial front-runners in making friends. But after early popularity, narcissism became a \"disadvantageous\" trait. For new students feeling overwhelmed by brash attention-seekers, the research offers hope that a more subtle approach will make them more likely to have friends and be popular in the long-run. The study, carried out by Dr Philip Leifeld in Glasgow and researchers in the US, Germany and the Jagiellonian University, in Krakow, Poland, looked at the dynamics of \"peer popularity\". It tracked 15 different peer groups of about 20 students from the first days of university to three months later to follow the fate of narcissists who at the outset were the centre of attention. The study, headed in Krakow by psychologist Anna Czarna, defined a narcissist as someone who had an \"excessively positive, undeserved self-regard\" and a \"constant desire for external self-affirmation\". Researchers compared the progress of the narcissists to that of students who were \"emotionally intelligent\" - and found that after a slower start, the emotionally intelligent began to gain friendships, and in a way that was more likely to last. Emotional intelligence was associated with a greater awareness of other people's emotions, showing empathy and caring for other people. Such traits were not necessarily immediately apparent - but the study found that the emotionally intelligent gradually grew in popularity, while the appeal of narcissists began to fade. A feature of narcissists was to \"denigrate\" others as a way of asserting their own position - and that as this happened they began to provoke \"significant dislike\". Dr Czarna said the project allowed researchers to examine the role of emotional behaviour in predicting popularity. \"Our results suggest that narcissism is rather disadvantageous and that emotional intelligence is rather advantageous for long-term popularity,\" the study said.", "question": "New students , in the first @placeholder days of making friends at university , are being told that being a narcissist only makes you popular in the short term .", "option_0": "powerful", "option_1": "awkward", "option_2": "annual", "option_3": "five", "option_4": "anticipated", "label": 1, "wrong_label": 3}

The ministry of tourism could also insist that all climbers have previous mountaineering experience.

Over the past decade many people have sought to establish world records on the world's highest mountain, a practice the government wants to discourage.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Champion fought cancer to win the world's most famous steeplechase at Aintree on his injury-plagued mount in 1981, and has been a tireless fundraiser ever since. He was given the Helen Rollason Award for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity at the 2011 BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. \"It's absolutely amazing, a great honour. I was shocked when I heard about it,\" the 63-year-old said. Champion overcame debilitating bouts of chemotherapy and months in hospital to triumph in the gruelling National over four-and-a-half miles and 30 demanding fences, and his story was made into the movie Champions where John Hurt played his character. The jockey helped set up the Bob Champion Cancer Trust in 1983, which has since gone on to raise in excess of \u00a312m for research into male cancers and has its own laboratory at the Royal Marsden Hospital, where he was treated. \"We initially had a few thousand pounds sent in from people who won money on the horse. There were a lot of fivers here and there,\" said Champion, who lives in Newmarket, Suffolk. \"They sent money to me care of the Royal Marsden. My doctor, Professor Sir Michael Peckham, and the horse's owner Nick Embiricos, thought it would be a good idea to set up a cancer trust. \"To go back to the hospital now and see scientists working in our research laboratory is fantastic to see. \"I had testicular cancer and was told I had a 35-40% chance of living. I thought it was a death sentence. Now the chances are 95% if it's caught early enough. \"In my time the chemotherapy was barbaric. I was sick 24 hours a day - it was awful, but now there are better anti-sickness drugs.\" In 2010, Champion raised \u00a3100,000 as he covered 17,500 miles visiting all 60 racecourses in the UK over 60 racedays. His previous efforts have included a horse ride from Buckingham Palace to Liverpool. Champion had dreamed of success in the Grand National since he was a boy watching black and white repeats of the contest on Pathe News at the cinema days after the race had been run. \"It was a race I always wanted to win. When I was in hospital some days having chemotherapy, I felt like giving up,\" he said. \"But I kept giving myself goals and thought hopefully I would get back and ride in a National. \"Aldaniti had problems with his legs and joints and always seemed to be on the injury list. He was in plaster in his stable for six months, and I was in and out of hospital for seven months. \"The vets wanted to put him down but they must have listened to me when I said he would win the National one day. What's not always been quite so well documented in Bob Champion's inspirational story is the bit that followed his riding career. Champion's raised all these millions not by sitting around waiting for donations, but by blood, sweat and tears, not so long ago completing an ambitious fund-raising walking tour of the country's racetracks. As a jockey, he was renowned for being hard and uncompromising, and in the ongoing battle against cancer, he lives up to that reputation, something that is justly recognised here. \"Maybe they gave him a chance to give me a little bit of hope in hospital. Thankfully, we got there together. \"The horse was eventually sound and he went from being an outsider to being second favourite. I suppose there was a lot of public money looking for a fairy story, and it came true.\" Trainer Josh Gifford still finds it hard to talk about the triumph without shedding a tear. \"Josh's loyalty was unbelievable. He always said the job was there when I came back. Whether he actually thought I would, I don't know,\" said Champion. \"Whenever the old horse's name comes up, he gets very emotional.\" Champion said the day after the National, when Aldaniti was paraded near Gifford's stables in Findon, West Sussex, brought the triumph home to him. \"The next day meant more to me, because thousands and thousands came to see the horse,\" he said. \"Some had travelled through the night. People came down from Scotland and one couple travelled over from France. \"That was really touching. It was the horse who did the work. I had the enjoyable bit.\" Champion's story is known all over the globe thanks to the movie. \"I was really honoured to be played by John Hurt,\" said Champion who won the Sports Personality Team of the Year award with Aldaniti 30 years ago. \"I promoted the film around the world so God knows how many people have seen it. I went to Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Tokyo and South Africa, as well as Europe.\" Champion says he is in good health despite a heart attack in March, which came exactly 10 years to the day after a previous heart scare, and does not tire of recalling his remarkable story. \"I still get emotional about it, although I might not show it.

The \"new pathway\" means easier access to citizenship, which allows access to a range of welfare services. The deal follows tensions over the deportation of New Zealand criminals under laws introduced last year. These laws allow Australia to deport any foreigners sentenced to more than 12 months in jail. Prime Minister Key previously said the issue was \"undermining [a] special relationship\". \"We traversed some of the concerns that we continue to have,\" he said in Sydney on Friday. \"We appreciate the work that  [Australia has] been doing around ensuring that people can appeal those decisions.\" Meanwhile, Mr Key formally extended the offer to take in some of the 267 asylum seekers awaiting deportation to Australia's offshore detention centre in Nauru. \"All I can simply say is the offer remains on the table,\" Mr Key said.

{"article": "The Labour politician is fighting a civil case against Norma Hunter, 69, over the use of a coal shed on the boundary of their properties. He wanted her banned from using the shed until the case was resolved, but the motion was thrown out. Mrs Hunter uses the shed - in Kings Park, Stirling - to store tools. Mr McConnell - now known as Baron McConnell of Glenscorrodale - and his wife, Bridget, argue that the 3ft by 3ft shed on the boundary of the garden is theirs. But Sheriff Wyllie Robertson threw out the McConnells' application for interim interdict from their lawyer Ian Smart, which would have banned Mrs Hunter from using the shed. Sheriff Robertson said: \"Let's be real about this. This is a motion for interim interdict. If the defender continues to use the cellar in breach of interdict the defender could be sent to prison.\" Stirling Sheriff Court heard the McConnells have a ground floor flat in Victoria Place, with retired Kirk minister Reverend Malcolm MacRae, 66, as their downstairs neighbour in the basement. Mrs Hunter owns the house next door. The cellar sits on its own at the back of their property, and can currently be accessed by Mrs Hunter, the McConnells, and the Reverend MacRae, but the clergyman is laying no claim to the cellar. Mr Smart argued the cellar was part of the staircase which was joined on to the basement of the McConnells' property, so therefore should be theirs. However, Anthony Quinn, for Mrs Hunter, said: \"The cellar is distinct from the internal staircase, and distinct from their property.\" Throwing out the interim interdict, Sheriff Robertson said: \"The real difficulty I have is the remedies for breach of interim interdict are penal.\" The case continues.", "question": "A @placeholder bid by ex-first minister Jack McConnell in a shed dispute has been dismissed as it could see his elderly neighbour sent to jail .", "option_0": "fresh", "option_1": "legal", "option_2": "spectacular", "option_3": "curious", "option_4": "mysterious", "label": 1, "wrong_label": 0}
{"article": "Research by the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) concluded that the behaviour patterns \"precede many suicide attempts\". The study said effective prevention measures were \"urgently needed\". The World Health Organisation estimates that there were more than 800,000 suicides worldwide in 2012. The ECNP study evaluated 2,811 patients suffering from depression, of whom 628 had previously attempted suicide. Researchers \"looked especially at the characteristics and behaviours of those who had attempted suicide\", and found that \"certain patterns recur\" before attempts. They said the risk of an attempt was \"at least 50% higher\" if a depressed patient displayed: Dr Dina Popovic, one of the report's authors, added: \"We found that 'depressive mixed states' often preceded suicide attempts. \"A depressive mixed state is where a patient is depressed, but also has symptoms of 'excitation', or mania.\" Michael Mansfield QC, whose daughter Anna took her own life earlier this year, said her death came \"out of the blue\". He said she had two children and a successful career, and no one suspected she was at risk of suicide. Speaking about the new research, he said: \"We want to know more. We want somebody to correlate all this and make sense of what seems like a senseless situation. \"So I would welcome anybody who's spent the time and bothered to assemble the pattern of behaviour because in Anna's case there was a pattern of behaviour and I for one didn't really spot it.\" Paul Farmer, of mental health charity Mind, said 6,000 UK people a year take their own lives - and \"we don't know enough about why that happens\". He said the ENCP research had an \"important message\" about the \"indicators that people should look out for\" if they are worried about someone.
